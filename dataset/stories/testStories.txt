I had n't been to a movie since I was a child . The one in my parents who would have been a real person . They thought I was a crazy person , and I was n't a real person anymore . I was a person that was n't a person . <newline> <newline> I was n't a person to the movies , but they were n't a person . They did n't even need to understand . They did n't want to understand . They did n't want to know what was happening , and they did n't want to see what I was doing . They did n't want to believe that I was a person . They did n't want to know what was happening . They thought I was a person . I was n't a person . They did n't want to know what was happening , but they did n't want to know how to make it happen . <newline> <newline> So I was n't a person . I was a person . I was a person . The ones that are n't a person . They are my family . They are
The wet marble floor pressed on his cheek like a thousand hands slapping his face frozen in time . <<unk>> piss of rain ignored his indignant mumblings . His eyes fluttered . Pins and needs ran from finger to shoulder as he pushed back against the floor , contorting his aching body into a cross legged position . Last night was bad . He gathered that . His routine dullness of though crept inwards from the edges of his mind toward the black mist that veiled his most recent memories . He struggled to recall whatever he could n't recall but only for a moment before he decided it probably was n't worth the effort . <newline> He glanced around the room for a few minutes before concluding that he probably did n't know where he was . His investigation was n't entirely fruitless , he discovered a mostly full bottle of vodka . It was cheap but would definitely get the job done . Taking a few swigs made it childishly easy to ignore that gigantic black cloud of fog blotting out whatever the hell he did before he woke up . <newline> There was a mirror in the room and for want of anything more interesting to study he gazed at himself . It was a game he 'd play with himself , glancing at the mirror and seeing if he could recognize the person looking back . If he did n't know better he 'd have guessed he was a very successful mattress salesman , or perhaps a bum who had managed to score some luck gambling . <newline> His face was portly and unshaven , in that limbo place where it had been too many days without being clean and too few days to become a beard . His stomach was round but firm , like a basketball stuffed under a shirt and then semi deflated . The hair was long and unruly , receding far into the past . But his eyes were the giveaway . Looking closely enough at them he could still see an intensity . It was n't the sharp kind he carried in his youth but rather like a rusted dagger . Still sharp enough to cut . <newline> `` DiCaprio . '' The curse rasped out of him in a choke . After all these years spent working on the hallmark channel and tv series based on mediocre movies he was still there . Despite his best efforts to bury himself under all of the <<unk>> and drugs he was still in there . He thought for sure after the bankruptcy he 'd be done , but no that god damned <<unk>> of Titanic the royalties started pouring in and he could n't get rid of the money . Not even the live action version of the nut job could destroy him . <newline> Cursing he hurled the bottle at the mirror but his wet hands slipped and instead of a shattering crash there was only a thud as the bottle bounced off the dry wall and rolled on the floor . <newline> His rage thwarted by his impotence he slumped against the floor and finally noticed why there was rain coming into this room . <newline> <newline> The window was smashed . He looked at the bottle , confused . No , he had n't done that . At least not with the vodka . He looked back at the glass etched around the window sill and his eyes hung on the red that stained the jagged teeth . <newline> <newline> The headache crept back towards the front of his mind while the bloody glass pinned his eyes in place . What the fuck happened last night ?

George fled . Not terrifically fast , not at his age nor in his shape . The voice echoed throughout the house after him . <newline> <newline> `` I 'm coming , you fat fuck ! You 've done me in and you 'll pay for it ! '' <newline> <newline> George wheezed into his office , closed the door and got to work tipping the file cabinet next to it . Over it went , blocking the door . He knelt at the safe set under his desk , opposite the door . <newline> <newline> There was a pounding at the door , a shoulder slamming into it . The cabinet held in place , thanks in some part to the thick carpet . The door pounded again as Bean slammed into it again , this time the wood cracking a little bit . <newline> <newline> `` I 'LL GET IN THERE YOU FAT FUCK ! '' Bean shouted . <newline> <newline> George twisted the lock furiously , muttering under his breath . `` Oh six ... Oh six ... Ninety six ... DAMNIT ! '' The lock failed to open . He tried again , a second time . <newline> <newline> `` Georgy <<unk>> , I 'm going to get in there and cut off your head just like you did me . I only wish *your* family were here to watch . '' <newline> <newline> The safe opened just as the door cracked in half . Martin pulled his pistol from the safe and rolled over just as Bean vaulted through the door , a gun in one hand and a sword in the other . <newline> <newline> **BANG** <newline> <newline> Bean fell to his knees as blood stained his pants . He raised his gun but too slowly , another shot rang out , **BANG ! ** This time blood stained his shirt as George hit him in the chest . <newline> <newline> `` Oh ... Oh George ... this is n't it . '' Bean wheezed as he collapsed . <newline> <newline> George R. R. Martin climbed to his feet as he heard the garage door go up . He took the gun from Bean 's cold dead hand and tossed it in the safe with the others , then met his wife in the kitchen as she came in with a load of groceries . <newline> <newline> `` George , dear , you look like you 've been running or something ! What 's happened ! '' <newline> <newline> `` It 's Bean again , Parris . He got close this time . '' <newline> <newline> `` Gods , how terrible ! What happened ? '' <newline> <newline> `` I shot him . Right in the chest . '' <newline> <newline> `` Again ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Oh yes . He just keeps coming back , only to die every time .

`` The last man is in the room . He is not the only one who 's not . '' <newline> <newline> The young man had been in this room for nearly a year now and it had not been a long time since he had been here . <newline> <newline> The door to the room was locked . In his hand he held a revolver . The barrel of a gun was still in the holster . <newline> <newline> `` This is not the end . This is what the man will do . '' <newline> <newline> The boy was in the room . The man had been here . <newline> <newline> He looked in the mirror . He was the one who had been there for a few decades now . He had been here for a few years and he had been here for over a week . The man was now in the room . <newline> <newline> `` What is the end of the world ? '' he thought to himself . <newline> <newline> The boy was sitting in the corner of the room , surrounded by hundreds of other men , and he had been
`` Hi dad ! '' <newline> <newline> The words snap me from my thoughts . I focus on the screen to see my son staring at me . He had a gap where a tooth had fallen out . <newline> <newline> I forcefully pull a fake smile back . `` Hey bud , how 's it going ! Is mom home ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Isaac , finish your homework first ! '' <newline> <newline> My wife 's voice makes my smile less forced . `` Alright Isaac , go do your homework . I promise we 'll talk more soon , alright ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Okay , dad . '' He replies , but the tone tells me he 's upset . His visage disappears and replaced by my wife 's . <newline> <newline> `` I swear , the smallest thing distracts that boy . '' Her hair is in a hasty bun , and judging by the glisten of sweat and the smudge on her cheek she had been in the garden . Her blue eyes show more relief than anything else . `` Hi honey , so nice to hear from you ! It 's been almost two weeks , is everything alright ? '' <newline> <newline> Her question brings me out it for second , and I ca n't seem to focus on anything . <newline> <newline> `` Mark ? '' <newline> <newline> I rub at my eyes to clear them , and open them to see my wife 's often kind face twisted with concern . <newline> <newline> `` Mark . '' <newline> <newline> `` No , everything 's not alright Emma ! '' I realized I yelled . `` No , nothing is alright . '' My eyes begin to go blurry again , this time from welling tears . Dammit , marines are n't supposed to cry . <newline> <newline> Emma retained her calm composure . `` What happened ? '' Was all she asked . <newline> <newline> I try to think , but it does n't work . Nothing is right , everything is jumbled . `` Jason . '' I 'm able to mumble out . <newline> <newline> `` Oh god ... '' I hear her get up from her chair . `` Isaac , go do your homework in your room for now . Daddy and I need to talk . '' By the time she gets back my composure is better . `` Mark , what happened ? '' <newline> <newline> ' '' We were ambushed . The area should have been cleared , but they must have missed them . We lost four men before we knew what was happening . Jason and I wound up next to each other behind a truck . '' I can feel my heart beating faster . I can still hear the gunfire , the crack of our weapons and the hiss of theirs . `` It looked like we were fighting them off , so we started following them . '' I remember the order from our CO , to kill every one of the bastards , ASAP . `` Jason and I glanced at each other , and I swear I could tell that he smiled at me . '' My voice begins to waver . Emma starts to speak but I hold up my hand . <newline> <newline> `` He did n't even get his shoulders above the ridge . It went through his neck . '' I remember watching , seeing the plasma bolt sear a hole straight through Jason 's helmet and out the back . Watched him fall backwards . <<unk>> over to him . `` He might have lived , the wound was n't anywhere vital in his neck , but his oxygen system was severed . '' I remember looking into his eyes , blue like his sister 's . Watched them go from shocked to panicked . Listened to him scream in pain , then start coughing , then gasping . Watched the skin around his eyes turn blue , hear his breathing grow more and more shallow . The fear in his eyes to the last moment as he stared at me , his hands like vices around my arms . <newline> <newline> `` Mark ... '' <newline> <newline> `` He asphyxiated before the medic could get to him . '' My hands start shaking , and my eyes blur with tears again . <newline> <newline> Emma does n't say anything , and we sit in silence for almost a whole minute . It seems like hours , and every second I remember it . His eyes staring back , blue like his skin . The medic prying me off of him , me screaming for Jason the whole time . <newline> <newline> `` Mark , it 's not your fault . '' <newline> <newline> `` If I had gotten up first , or we had waited just another second , he may be alive ! '' I catch myself yelling again . `` When we enlisted , I promised to keep him safe . '' <newline> <newline> `` You did all you could . '' <newline> <newline> `` I could have done more . '' <newline> <newline> More silence . I hate it , almost as much as the sound of battle . Every little sound rings in my ears . I ca n't take it , and force myself to talk . <newline> <newline> `` They asked if I wanted to escort him back . '' <newline> <newline> `` What ? '' She looks back , confusion replacing sorrow . <newline> <newline> `` My CO requested it . He knew mine and Jason 's connection , and felt it would be better to send him home with a friend . I leave the front tomorrow , I should be home by next week . '' <newline> <newline>
I sat there for a moment , thinking about the last one . <newline> <newline> I was n't sure what to do . I knew I should have known I would have to come home and get some rest . <newline> <newline> I had a plan . My job . My job . I had a plan . I had to go to a hospital . I had to get in . I had to get out of the hospital and make sure I got home to my wife . <newline> <newline> I had to get out of the hospital . It was my time . I had to get out of the hospital , so I could get out of the ER . I had to get out of the hospital . I was just going to go to the hospital . <newline> <newline> I was going to go to the doctor 's room . I was going to get out of the hospital . I had to hurry . If there would be a doctor , I would have to leave the hospital . I had to make sure he did n't get out of the hospital .
It was a beautiful day in the United States . The air was warm and the wind had been rising for years . The sun had gone up , illuminating the sky . The clouds had begun to come to life . <newline> <newline> `` Hey , buddy . '' <newline> <newline> I stood , and walked to the door . I opened it and walked inside . The door was unlocked , but I could n't make out what he was saying . <newline> <newline> `` Hello , sir . '' He said with a smile . <newline> <newline> `` Hi , '' I said again . `` What do you think ? '' <newline> <newline> He looked me in the eyes as he spoke . <newline> <newline> `` I have to ask , '' he said , `` why are you here ? '' <newline> <newline> `` I 'm not here to discuss the situation , but I 'm here to explain the situation , '' I said , `` we have a few days before they are ready in case you want to talk about it . '' <newline> <newline> `` I 'm here to explain the
It was a strange thing , he could see it in the people 's eyes as it was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen . The man who saw it had a smile in his eyes and an air of superiority . His hair was long and thin , and his face was pale and full of wrinkles , his face was white and his eyes were dark blue , and his face was like the most beautiful thing he had ever seen in his life . His eyes were a dull black and the light was a dark blue and his mouth was black like the other people 's eyes . And he was wearing a red hat , and he wore a white hat that was a color that was not black , but not black . <newline> <newline> <newline> He looked up at the man who was in front of him , and the man who had once been his friend . The man who had been his friends , his family , and all of their friends . He was sitting on a couch , looking up at the sun . The man who
`` It 's just that half of all them gals down there are just bitches , ripe bitches , '' some young white punk with greasy <<unk>> said as he lifted up his glass of vodka . `` This one be for the bitches . '' <newline> <newline> The crew of young high school dropouts lifted their glasses and banged them together . The smell of cigarettes and Doritos polluted the bar as they simultaneously exhaled after slamming their empty glasses on the table obnoxiously hard . For the next hour and half they energetically went through a myriad of conversation topics -- porn , ex-girlfriends , heroine , cars , dead friends , and alcohol . Their banter slowly descended into a madness of laughter , shot after shot . Suddenly they were hushed . <newline> <newline> An elderly man opened the bar door . A white light from the street temporarily blinded the table of boys . The man pathetically shuffled over to the counter . He wore a worn-out plaid jacket and a pair of corduroy pants . Lightly tapping the table with his fingers , a husky bartender leaned over . <newline> <newline> `` Need help , friend ? '' the bartender said , keeping an eye on the group of kids who were now suspiciously looking at the old man . <newline> <newline> `` Yeah , '' the old man said . `` Just a shot of scotch for now . Actually I 'll do two right now . '' <newline> <newline> `` Sure thing . '' <newline> <newline> The old man sighed as he looked at his watch . It was a habit . He was n't going anywhere later . He had no meeting to go to , no one to see , no job , no curfew . He thought sometimes that if the hand struck twelve , he would die . It was a habit though . <newline> <newline> `` Hey hey how ya doin there sucker ? '' the kid with <<unk>> said , while taking a seat on the vinyl chair at the bar next to the old man . <newline> <newline> The old man glared over at him . For some reason he knew he would get dragged into some joke of a conversation with one of those kids . <newline> <newline> `` I do n't know , sucker . '' the old man said while the bartender slid two shots of scotch in front of him . <newline> <newline> `` Course you do , you just think I 'm being some <<unk>> punk for doing this . '' <newline> <newline> `` So ? '' the old man lifted a shot to his mouth a poured it down . `` Got any reason for talking to me ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Yeah , yeah I do sucker . You been in war ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Sure . '' <newline> <newline> `` Then you know what -- '' <newline> <newline> `` What it 's like to have a gun pointed at me ? '' <newline> <newline> The old man noticed a small silver handgun concealed under the kid 's grey sweatshirt . <newline> <newline> `` How much fuckin ' dope you got ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Doe and dope are two different things . '' <newline> <newline> `` <<unk>> doe then ? '' <newline> <newline> `` About a hundred , '' the old man said , lifting the second glass up to his lips . <newline> <newline> `` I want it , '' the kid said , tensing his index finger on the trigger . `` Gim me . '' <newline> <newline> The kid was sweating at this point . He was more distraught than the man . <newline> <newline> `` Okay , '' the old man said while the scotch was lifted up to his mouth . `` Let me finish . '' <newline> <newline> `` Finish the fuckin ' drink <<unk>> . '' <newline> <newline> The old man lifted the empty glass from his mouth and threw it across the room . It shattered against the wall . <newline> <newline> `` No , I mean finish this . '' <newline> <newline> Suddenly a burst of white fire consumed the bar . The wooden pillars gave way and a cloud of dust arose while the building collapsed . It was all rubble now . Bodies lay across the ground . The kid with the <<unk>> collapsed , bricks crushing his legs , his face covered in a pale coating of dust . The old man shuffled to him and showed him his watch . The hand struck twelve . <newline> <newline> `` Okay , '' the old man said while glancing at his watch . `` Time for you to die . ''
“ It ’ s just a little more <unk> ” <newline> <newline> “ You should be . This is a <unk> ” <newline> <newline> I had no idea how I had done this to him , but I knew that he was trying to tell me that he was just trying to tell me that I was going to be the one to stop this . I wanted to know what he was going to say , but I knew that he was going to be a hero and that he was going to be the one to stop this . <newline> <newline> “ You ’ re not going to be the one to stop this .

It 's a simple thing , the fact that I 've got a lot of the same people . I 've been in the same house for three years now , I 've never been to this house . I 've never had a friend that has n't been to the house . The house I 'm in has to be made by the police . It 's been a long time since I 've seen anyone 's face in the mirror , and I 've never had a friend that has n't been to the house . I 'm not sure why I 've gone to the house , but I 'm sure it 's just me . <newline> <newline> My house , I 'm sure it 's a nice house . There were many of these people who have n't been to the house for a long time . I 'm not sure how the house works , but it 's not that they do n't have any windows , or even windows . I do n't know how I know about it , but I have n't ever made anything . <newline> <newline> I 'm not sure
The first thing I noticed when my head was spinning was my head spinning . I had been walking for about a minute , and the smell of the water was the only sound I could hear . <newline> <newline> `` What 's going on ? '' I said aloud . <newline> <newline> I heard a voice in the distance . `` Hey , I thought you 'd come over here . I need you to come over here . '' <newline> <newline> I looked up . The voice was a tall , lanky man from my late twenties . His dark hair seemed to glisten under the sun . His face was covered in dark grey hair , and he was wearing a black leather sweatshirt . His black eyes looked like he was trying to hide his fear . <newline> <newline> `` Hey , you . What 's your name , boy ? '' <newline> <newline> There was a short pause . `` <unk> '' <newline> <newline> `` My name is <unk> . What 's your name ? '' <newline> <newline> `` My name is <unk> . I 'm from the <unk> , and I 'm from the
Just looking at the guy I already knew it . He was in for a seven on the Bristol scale and it was only hours away . <newline> <newline> Looking at his carefree face from below as he was slowly transported towards me on the escalator , I wondered , not for the first time , if I should warn him . But as always I asked myself : How could I tell him ? How could I tell anyone ? <newline> <newline> Tell people that I could see the future . That I could see their fate ? That I could feel the forces that were at work , often without their knowledge and beyond their control , inside their own bodies ? That I could see shape of things to come ? That I was a <<unk>> ? <newline> <newline> Nobody would believe me . Not until after a few predictions had been proven to be correct at least and few humored me for long enough to realize the truth of my predictions . <newline> <newline> And this guy did n't have a few predictions to confirm the <<unk>> of my gift . He needed to know and believe me about the very next event I could foresee and there was no way to convince him in time . <newline> <newline> And thus I stayed silent again as the escalator carried us past one another leaving him to his fate . I was going up and he was going down . <newline> <newline> I could only hope for him that he would be close to the right place two hours and thirteen minutes from now , because I could tell it would be a fast and quite explosive one and without my word he would not have much advanced warning telling him to run for salvation . <newline> <newline> I put him out of my mind I had my own future to worry about and I did n't need my gift to tell me about it . I started looking for the signs pointing the way to closest lavatory .
It was a normal day when you noticed that your mind was spinning around like a ghost . The first thing you noticed , was the lack of sleep . The first thing you noticed was the feeling of having a heart attack . Then again , when you noticed , the first thing you noticed was the feeling of the world in your eyes . It was n't the first time you noticed it , but that 's what I was . <newline> <newline> I looked over to my reflection to see the face that had appeared before me , and saw that it was me . The face that looked like it had changed from a human to a human . A human , that 's what they called themselves , the face that looked like it was a human . That 's what I was , and the face that looked like it looked like me . The face that looked like mine . The face that was a human . The face that looked like my own , I saw the face that looked like mine . The face of the person I loved . The
Carnival music seemed to dance in the background . A cacophony of color and knick knacks decorated the fairgrounds . It was just another day at the carnival . I sit at my stand reading another old junky sci-fi novel . <newline> <newline> “ So how much to see it ? ” <newline> <newline> Some pre-teen girl interrupted my book with her piercing voice . I sigh towards her and lean in . <newline> <newline> “ Ten dollars , just like the sign says. ” <newline> <newline> “ And it works ? ” <newline> <newline> “ So I ’ m told . ” <newline> <newline> “ You mean you ’ ve never looked ? ” <newline> <newline> “ Nope , ” I say , picking my book back up . <newline> <newline> “ Well why not. ” <newline> <newline> “ Because some things in this life should be a mystery , ” I reply . <newline> <newline> “ Well I want to see , ” she says . I tap on the money box and she places her ten dollars in . I watch her go in and wait for the audible reaction . After a couple of seconds I can hear an excited squeal . She runs out jumping up and down . <newline> <newline> “ He ’ s so handsome ! ” <newline> <newline> I can see her run off in excitement . I smirk . Another idiot , I think to myself . The carnival director walks up shortly after . <newline> <newline> “ Time to start packing up , Isaac , ” he says . I nod and begin to break down my stand . <newline> <newline> My table is put away , and the money is locked up now . It ’ s that time again to put away the mirror . I stand in front of it like every other day . It ’ s just me , again . Same as yesterday , and the day before that , I am alone in the reflection . <newline> <newline> I smile at my reflection as I cover the mirror . I put the tent and everything in the back of my trailer with a skip in my step . <newline> <newline> You have to feel sorry for these suckers , I think . They ’ re destined for one person only . Who knows if they ’ ll ever find them ? At least I know where to always find myself .
`` Hey , I 'm just doing this . '' <newline> <newline> `` Hey , you know that 's the last time I see you . I 'm not doing this ! '' <newline> <newline> `` Yeah , I know .

The sun rose beautifully over the cityscape , painting the clouds with its rays in pastel hues , colors changing as particles of light refracted and reflected , bouncing around the skies aimless and endless , purposeless , never to rest , and most of all unknowing of their own vain labors . <newline> <newline> Ray stepped over the guardrail and perched on the precipice of his <<unk>> lookout , pensive . Many things ran through his mind ; his shitty job , his hateful parents , the loss of his wife , the only person he 'd ever truly loved . But mostly he wondered how his reaper could have abandoned him so . <newline> <newline> To most people , a reaper was a curse : a constant reminder that death was always there , waiting . An undeniable proof that no one lives forever , and everyone will die sooner than they think . The closer it was , the sooner you would die . <newline> <newline> Despite society 's countless incredible technological achievements , they could never figure out how to separate themselves from death personified . This never stopped the rich and powerful from trying ; as their reapers got closer , no insane pitch from a <<unk>> entrepreneur was too outlandish for the wealthy to throw their money at . They called them Death Profits : a play on words of both the money made from misfortune and the undeniable truth that their failures proved . The diamond guillotine , the snake oil supplements , the guided meditation and isolation , even the <<unk>> trips to space ; nothing could rid a person of their reaper . <newline> <newline> Which is why Ray loved his . Where most saw a terrifying ghoul , Ray saw a comforting promise . A guarantee that he would not have to exist forever . When his wife was killed in the car crash , Ray had seen in the rearview his own eyes , his own fear reflected as his wife 's reaper came barreling in from behind . In just a moment he realized it all ; they were due a freak accident , a change of fate . And then , grotesquely , a smaller reaper , its ghostly feet beating a silent <<unk>> , arm outstretched as it struggled to keep up with its mother . <newline> <newline> His daughter in the back . She was being cooed at by her laughing mother , gurgling happily in her carseat , blissful in her unknowing . What could Ray do ? *WHAT COULD HE DO ? * A thousand thoughts crossed his mind . <<unk>> it somehow . Change fate . Swerve off the road . Offer your life as collateral . Pray for their earthly salvation . Something , something ! * <newline> <newline> She looked to him , one last time . In that final moment . Her eyes met his , laughing creases changing to worry in slow motion as she saw the unbridled terror in his eyes , he could see everything , he knew as her mouth begin to move in formation of the question <<unk>> <<unk>> , it was too late , too late , and he would never forget . He could see it now in his mind in perfect detail , wind streaming in the half-open window , playing lazily with that lock of hair that she could never keep tied back . Her lovely chest beneath her white sweater expanding ever so slightly , unfettered by the seatbelt she hated so much to wear . The <<unk>> green of her questioning eyes in the light , the pupils contracting in turn as the sun flowed over one before the other . Her soft lips just beginning to form his name , asking him to protect her , save them , keep her safe : his wife , the mother of his child , his only love and the only thing he ever loved , *save us Ray , save our baby* and yet he failed her , just as with everything else , he failed her too and her would never forgive himself . <newline> <newline> *Remember , Ray . Memorize it . Remember what you did . Never forget . * <newline> <newline> Just before the impact he could not find his reaper . He knew what was coming and he did not want to live , without them there would be nothing to live for and he knew he could not save them and he wanted to die . But his reaper was not there . It was not there and then the impact came , his world ending in a great explosive conglomeration of crashing glass and screeching metal and shrieking twisting screaming tearing and then blood , theirs and his mixed up slick and smelling of iron and heat in the smoldering car . <newline> <newline> She had gone through the windshield . There was a gash above his head pouring blood but remarkably his limbs were intact and he crawled out of the overturned car to find her , cutting his hands and knees on the crystal shards that lay in a carpet around the vehicle . His ears were ringing . As he failed to stand , he realized he could hear the baby crying weakly . He tried the door but it would n't budge . He surrendered his broken hands and pulled with all his might , the glass cutting into his fingers and bleeding down and around the handle . Nothing . He was raising his elbow to smash it into the glass , and then felt a ghastly chill . <newline> <newline> It was passing through him . Her reaper . Bony arms outstretched , wisps of ethereal smoke trailing behind as it moved to fulfill its grotesque
`` So , why does this have to be a problem ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Oh , well , you know , I 've never really been one for it .

I was a good kid . <newline> <newline> When I was a kid , I had to go outside with my wife and kids .

I lifted the box of cereal , tilted it down a bit , and sent a shower of Lucky Charms cascading into the bowl .

I eyed the half-empty pallet of cereal boxes in my dining room next to the twenty-something gallons of milk I 'd bought . Outside , the sun had nearly reached its apex . Noon already ?

I was in the middle of nowhere . It was a little chilly for a day , so I went to the local diner and sat down at the bar . I took a sip and sipped and looked up . <newline> <newline> I had been talking about something for a while now . It was a little old man , but he had been sitting on the bar . The old man had been talking to me about something . The old man had n't talked to me about anything , he had never talked to me about anything , and he had n't talked to me since . I was just a kid . I was a little kid . <newline> <newline> It was a little early , but I did n't have a lot of time to think about anything . I sat down on the bar . It was a little chilly , but I did have the time to think about it . <newline> <newline> I sat down on the bar . I had a long way to go . I was a little old and I had the time to think about it .
The gravel crunches under my feet as I walk , steps in time with the music that echoes in my ears . Bach . A genius , to be sure . I 've always liked his music . Partially for the way it makes me seem more wise , perhaps , and partially just out of a genuine enjoyment of his work . <newline> <newline> * '' You think you can just replace me ? ! `` * <newline> <newline> It takes me a tenth of a second to register the voice and spin around . There , raising his hands in twin fists , is someone *very* familiar . <newline> <newline> `` James ? '' I query , taking an instinctive step back even as I feel knowledge of various martial arts <<unk>> flooding into my mind . `` Is that you ? '' <newline> <newline> He takes a step forward , and I can see he 's panting , out of breath . `` James is my brother ! I 'm *you* , you fucking idiot ! '' <newline> <newline> It 's simple to keep my distance from him . The key with aggressors is to back off slowly , not giving them an excuse to close the <<unk>> gap . `` Please , there 's no need to get angry . I 'm not quite sure what you mean . *I'm* me . '' <newline> <newline> Unfortunately , my technique is not quite perfect - or perhaps it just does not matter - and he advances anyways . Now that the initial shock of someone screaming and swearing ( ugh ) at me has worn off , I 'm free to examine him . To be quite honest , I must admit he does look like me . He 's a tad malnourished , not even close to being in shape , and has a potbelly that does n't quite fit on his frame , but otherwise he looks similar to a me that has n't washed or shaved in a week . <newline> <newline> `` I do n't know who the *hell* you are but you are going to get the fuck out of my city ! Out of my *home* ! You ... you ca n't just replace me ! '' One fist turns into a pointing hand , stabbing me in the chest with his index finger . I do n't think he quite expects the resistance he receives . <newline> <newline> `` I 'm sorry , sir , but I 'm afraid I do n't know who you are or why you think I 've replaced you . Perhaps you should try inquiring about this at a local police department ? '' *Rule three-hundred and seventy-nine . <<unk>> to the local police for matters requiring authority . * Huh ? <newline> <newline> He growls , and he 's in my personal space , now . Not something I am entirely comfortable with , but it 's nothing that would set me off . Staying calm is always the correct path to take . `` Look , *kid* , you 're going to fuck off or die or something *right now* because I 'm going home ! To *my* home ! Not *yours* ! '' <newline> <newline> I see the shove coming , and let him do it . My stumble backwards is entirely anticipated , and I feel *great* . It 's such a nice day outside . The man- <newline> <newline> What man ? <newline> <newline> I swivel around , blinking and searching for someone . I 'm not quite sure who . There 's nothing there . <newline> <newline> Something *is* odd , though . <newline> <newline> In the corner of my eye , I see a truck retreating into the distance , coloured completely white . <newline> <newline> It 's not that . The hands on my watch have jumped forward by seven minutes and fifty-nine seconds . <newline> <newline> Odd .
`` It 's not like you can just do anything '' said a young , balding woman dressed in a black and white dress . <newline> <newline> `` Oh , no , that 's not the case .

* '' The Alliance ... Will die . As will your friends . Good . I can* **feel** *your anger . I am defenseless . Strike me down with all of your hatred and your journey to the dark side will be complete ! `` * ~ The Last Words of Emperor Sheev Palpatine <newline> <newline> _______________________ <newline> <newline> <newline> Luke could feel his father calling to him through the force , upset with his lack of punctuality . He started jogging through the corridors of the Death Star . Everyone he passed gave him more room than they would anyone else . Luke sensed their fear , and smiled . Soldiers should fear their commanders ; it was the right way of things . Position alone does not give one the right to lead . Excellence alone is not a reason to be followed . If you intend to rule , your subordinates must see your strength , and submit to it . Anyone who thought differently was either misinformed or simply a fool . The regional governors in this meeting will be both . <newline> <newline> Luke sighed as he considered the conversation to come . It will be the same as the one with the Rebel leaders . Well almost the same . The Rebel leaders were so surprised to see Luke standing alongside his father that they did not speak for a long time . And when they did , they were so held back that the meeting accomplished nothing . His father had tried to explain to them that things would be better now . The injustice in Galaxy stemmed from Emperor Palpatine alone . Together , the two <<unk>> would lead the Galaxy to true peace . They did not believe him , but they will come around . Leia did not attend . <newline> <newline> Leia . The thought of her pushed Luke ’ s thoughts in a different direction . He felt an old pull , remembering Leia , Han , Chewie . R2 and <<unk>> . And old Ben . He did not like to think about them . He had done what was necessary to save their Galaxy . They were never in his position . When you are weak , you can never understand the decisions the powerful must make . And live with . They too , will one day understand . The power Luke and his father have together . They can make things the way they want them to be . As always , this line of thought led frustratingly nowhere , so he pushed it from his mind to focus on the upcoming meeting . <newline> <newline> This meeting with the regional governors , only a few years removed from being Senators , would be unbearable . Even before he joined his father , Luke had hated politicians . What an egregious waste of time ! Petty fools , arguing over nothing but pride ! There were precious few , Leia ’ s late father among them , who governed for the good of their people . Leia . No , she was not to be thought of . Luke pushed the thought away more powerfully than before . Focus on the governors . They will be weak . They will ask for things they do not need , for power they do not deserve . Their existence is an unfortunate by-product of the size of the Galaxy , nothing more . They will be short-sighted ; incapable of understanding the great things Luke and his Father can accomplish together ! <newline> <newline> And accomplish great things they will ! As the only two force users left , they can lead the Galaxy to a rich a prosperous future ! And as Luke ’ s father ages , they will seek out Leia and Han , for their child will be tied to the force as Luke and his Father are . Leia ’ s son will be the next in line to learn the ways of the Force from Luke . They will use their family ’ s talents to rule the Galaxy for centuries to come . <newline> <newline> Finally , Luke reached the conference room . As he stepped into the room he heard his father ’ s voice , and smiled . <newline> <newline> “ <<unk>> Welcome , my son. ” <newline> <newline> _______ <newline> <newline> Hope I 'm not too late . I really liked the ideas from Anakin in Episode III , when he tells Padme that he can overthrow Palpatine and the two of them can rule , and again in Episode V when Vader tells Luke the same thing . I also wanted to take the `` villain won '' part of the prompt and try to not make it so cut and dry . <newline> <newline> Lastly , I 'm not a writer by any means , I just saw this prompt and thought it would be really fun to try . <newline>
It took me a moment to realize I was n't in the mood to see him again . He was in the middle of nowhere , the only thing left to do was to stand up and walk up to him . <newline> <newline> `` I 'm not here to be here to be here . '' It was my turn to say that to me . I 'd been a good person for a long time , and I was n't so sure of that . <newline> <newline> `` No , I 'm not here to be here . '' He said with a calm voice . <newline> <newline> `` You 're not here to be here ! '' I said , trying to hide the tears in my eyes . `` Do n't you dare , do n't you dare . '' <newline> <newline> He stood there for a moment , and then walked over to me . He was n't a strong man , and I knew that . I did n't know how to explain it , I just knew that he was n't going to be there to save my life . <newline> <newline> I

Might as well put something in . I tried this prompt a while ago , and got one response from <<unk>> . Here was their response : <newline> <newline> He had always suspected that it might get ugly , but he never thought it could go this far . He took a look at the knife lying on the floor . There was blood on the carpet , blood on the walls and even blood on the ceiling .

Trying to keep his calm , he went through the door . <newline> <newline> <newline> For easier reading , the other way around : <newline> <newline> Trying to keep his calm , he went through the door . The man and his wife had fought before and the police had been called to the flat before , but none of the fights had been this bad .

The door opened and a girl with long brown hair walked into a room and sat down next to him . <newline> <newline> `` Hey '' she said , `` I 'm afraid the door is open '' <newline> <newline> `` What ?

Jennifer woke up in a dark room , no light . She rubbed her eyes as if that would help her to see . `` Oh god ... what in the hell ... ? '' She threw herself on bed again , too exhausted to move . <newline> <newline> Not that she remembers , but waking up in the dark room with no memory happens to her on regular bases . If she has a bad day , she turns off the light before she goes to sleep so she does n't have to think about anything , and possibly avoid nightmares . <newline> <newline> But what the hell happened last night that made her this tired ? It must have been something horrible . Last time she was this tired to wake up was when her dog died . She stayed in her dark room for 2 days straight . <newline> <newline> `` I should get something to eat '' Jennifer woke herself up and opened the door . From the distance , she saw a dim light from kitchen 's curtain . A memory came back . <newline> <newline> `` Lucy ! '' She yelled as she remembered her 4 months old daughter . `` Oh god Lucy , my baby , Mommy is coming ! '' She started to wander in the dark hallway and tripped over an object . <newline> <newline> `` What the hell was that ... ? '' she muttered as she fell on the ground . The floor was wet and it was still too dark to see anything . `` And what is that smell ? '' a terrible smells started to fill out the air . It was coming from the object that tripped her . She stretched her hands , trying to find the object , the source of the smell . <newline> <newline> She followed the smell and got to touch the object . It was soft yet cold . She instantly knew something was terribly wrong . <newline> <newline> `` No ... It can ’ t bee ... '' She had to know what was going on . Still not admitting the reality , she carried the object and walked toward the kitchen . She wanted to make sure under the light . <newline> <newline> As she came close to the light , her memory started to come back . Her childhood , college , wedding , pregnancy , Lucy , and when she remembered her argument with David last week , she stopped . <newline> <newline> She fell down to her knees and tears started to stream down her cheeks . `` Mommy is sorry Lucy ... Mommy is so sorry ... '' <newline> <newline> She put Lucy back on the floor and head back to her room . She knew what she had to do , or what she could only do . <newline> <newline> She closed the door behind her and just before the dim light from the kitchen went completely off , she said <newline> <newline> `` Hi David '' <newline>

I had just gotten into the car . I had just gotten into the car , and my mom had just stopped driving and had started driving .

I 'm not especially smart . <newline> <newline> Maybe that 's why everyone seems to hate me . My job , of course , was one that required someone especially smart . Someone like Winston Churchill 's third nephew or Abraham Lincoln 's half ancestor . But they chose me . <newline> <newline> Was n't my fault , being chosen . I mean , shit , I did n't even apply for the job . I applied for almost 20 jobs over the summer and the one that chooses me was the one job in the whole God-damned universe that I did n't even want . <newline> <newline> I got a call back from Safeway as well , but they were just trying to give me advice on what to say . So many people trying to give me advice on what to say . <newline> <newline> I suppose being chosen to be the voice of the entire species puts a certain target on your back , one that means , *Hey , come manipulate me or we all fuckin ' die ! * <newline> <newline> But they chose me , the aliens did . They chose *me* to plead the case of Humanity 's existence , not Einstein 's lesser known son . *Me . * <newline> <newline> I walked passed one of the countless shops playing my speech on the TV . It was a McDonalds , for crying out loud . Were they even aloud to have TV 's in their windows ? I supposed it did n't matter , since we would all be dead soon anyway , but shit . As always , they cropped it out to show only the bad part . The subtitles spelled out the words so even the deaf could see my fuck up . <newline> <newline> `` If you decide to exterminate us , make damn sure you do it right the first time , or we 'll come after you . '' <newline> <newline> The picture switched to a news anchor drinking straight out of a bottle of vodka . <newline> <newline> `` He 'd *killed* us all !

I sat down on my couch , watching the news and watching the news . It was my first day on the job , at least for a few days , I 'd gone to work at work at a local local community , I knew what I had to do , they did n't know I had to be in work , and I was n't going to be in work .

I had been running late to work for the last few days , and I was going to find out where the hell I got from . This was going to be a long day . I needed my job , but I needed my job .

As I finished up my research on Alligator breeding habits for a story I was tasked with writing , a bell began to ring loudly throughout the office . I could feel the sound vibrating off the cubicle walls . I looked over my cubicle wall to ask a co-worker what the bell was for . <newline> <newline> I watched as he calmly opened his desk drawer , to reveal a small armory . There were multiple handguns , knives and magazines and other assorted weapons neatly stashed away . <newline> <newline> `` What the hell is that for ? '' I questioned loudly , and nervously . <newline> <newline> The man looked me in the eyes , and pointed his handgun at my face . I saw my life flash before my eyes , and could n't understand what circumstances had arisen to put me in this position . I heard the gun fire , and the sound of the shot rang through my ears . <newline> <newline> I heard something hit the ground loudly behind me . I turned to see the woman who had hired me yesterday , lying in a pool of blood on the floor . She was holding a rifle in her arms . I looked back at the man who had apparently just saved my life . He seemed to be about 40 or so , well built , muscular and had a scar down the right side of his face that went from his forehead down to his beard . <newline> <newline> `` She liked to go after the new hires '' he explained in a deep voice . `` She hires the ones she wants to kill '' <newline> <newline> I was n't sure what to make of this , but my thoughts were cut off by the sounds of screaming throughout the building . <newline> <newline> `` What 's happening '' I asked , barely able to look my savior in the eyes . <newline> <newline> `` You survive today , and you 'll receive a bonus of $ 5,000 and your salary will be raised 5 % '' I cut the man off . <newline> <newline> `` What does that ? '' He continued to speak , while motioning me to stop taking . <newline> <newline> `` I 'll keep you alive , if you give me your bonus and half your raise '' He finished . <newline> <newline> I just nodded , still unable to understand the position I was in . <newline> <newline> He grabbed my arm so hard I thought it would break , and pulled me over the cubicle wall , and under his desk . Then , he placed a gun in my hand . <newline> <newline> `` The safety is on , and it 's fully loaded with one in the chamber '' He said , pointing to the safety switch . <newline> <newline> The weapon felt heavy in my hand , I flicked the safety off with my thumb and gripped the gun tightly . <newline> <newline> The man looked down at his watch . `` 45 minutes to go ''
`` You 're going to be dead '' the man in the suit said , his eyes darting from side to side . `` You 're gon na be dead .

I remember the first time I heard that voice . It was a strange voice . It sounded like a woman 's voice , and the voice sounded like a man in his thirties . It was like a voice . The voice was different , and it was like a voice . The voice was the voice that made me feel like a kid . <newline> <newline> `` I 'm not here to tell you what I 'm here to tell you . You 're the only one that knows what 's going on . I 'm here to tell you what 's going on . '' <newline> <newline> I was scared . <newline> <newline> `` You 're not here to tell me something .

Something in the way he said it made you shiver . You knew when you first met him that something was off , and with the way he reacted to that scream you knew . `` What have you done ? '' I asked , afraid I already knew the answer . `` The same thing that will happen to you . '' His eyes were glistening with tears . `` The same thing ! '' I began to run . Almost instinctively I ran towards the scream . `` Ahhh . '' There it was again , getting closer now . I looked up to a girl that was cocooned in a tree , only her head visible . `` Hold on , I 'll get you down from there '' I yelled , forgetting about the guide I left behind me . That 's when I heard it , the clicking of several little feet . It was the only thing I heard , but I could not pinpoint where it was coming from . Thats when I noticed the girl . She was staring at something behind me , her eyes moving ever so slightly . The look of terror on her face held me in place . `` It 's behind me . '' I said under my breathe , as I spun around . It was the tour guide , only his bottom half was now a giant spider and his face had pincers . A <<unk>> . `` She was n't cocooned , she was webbed . '' Was the only thought I had time for before the bite . All went black . <newline> <newline> <newline>

Hardest game in the world , adored by many . Medieval setting with a realistically difficult fight engine that forces you to die again and again until you finally get it right .

The <unk> was n't the best . The only thing that was a part of my life was my own life . My life is not that good . <newline> <newline> I had to live for a long time . It had been a few days since I had seen my friends . But I still had to live . I was not a good person . But I had a good life . I was a good man . <newline> <newline> My life is not so bad . There was no life . My heart was racing and I could n't move . My life was so bad that I could n't see . My eyes closed and I felt the pain in my chest . <newline> <newline> The pain was so much worse than it was when I realized I was a little less depressed than it was before I was dead . I felt like I was a child . I felt like I had been alive all my life . <newline> <newline> I was n't a child . I was n't a child . I was n't just a child . I was a little more
Motor sport vehicles were the first to be outlawed . When you tell a man he has a day to live , and remind him he could have been a monster car driver if he had n't knocked that slut up in high school , more often then not , you end up with a wrecked truck and a dead man . Which is fine , insurance pays and you garnish the wages of his progeny for three generations . To outsiders , it just looks a little ... exploitative . <newline> <newline> It happens to everyone . You wake up drenched in sweat , with crystal clear knowledge of the totality of your failure . To some men , the heights they could have soared made recognizing this day nearly impossible . For many , the dream came with the depressing realization of how little they could have amounted to . But for those in the middle , those who cold yet conceive of a perfectly actualized life , the allure of this alternate reality consumed even the knowledge of their imminent demise . This combination of hope and <<unk>> was the lifeblood of payday <<unk>> for generations , it took them an embarrassingly long amount of time to tap this market . <newline> <newline> The applications were the <<unk>> of lunatics , incapable of separating their life of booze sodden compromise from the cloistered life of work and neglect which lead to their best selves And at the bottom of each is the untidy scrawled signature of the approving manager . Auto sports , oil prospecting , and pyrotechnics were all out . Cupcake bakery had become a fairly wise investment , after the first hundred thousand went under . For the most part though , these impossible missions were inaugurated with the nod of a middle manager . <newline> <newline> They walked out of the florescent lobby and back into the lobby of a bank . There was a time when a man could show up at a medical supply store looking to buy one operating room in cash , but it was never long before a man in a faded polyester suit and a summons came to politely ask for all that money back . Cash or an overpriced platinum card , it made no difference . Purchasing alone took hours , and many had stress induced <<unk>> or wrapped their business <<unk>> around a pole before lunchtime . The hardier souls remaining sometimes even had optimism sufficient to order business cards before they succumbed . <newline> <newline> Then came the collectors to inform the family their property was now forfeit . <<unk>> matters somewhat was the fact this was often the first the family had heard of their dearly departed for some time . Not many perfect lives contained imperfect families . <<unk>> were held , and deals made . Cheap <<unk>> yielded coarse ashes in a bargain vase .

I thought to myself , <<unk>> was practically immortal , simply because he could regenerate from any wound , a handy trait to possess in our line of work . But the side effect was that to keep up this unbreakable defence , he was always hungry , and had to consume copious amounts of food , often at the expense of the Ministry that funded us . <newline> <newline> The conversation between my companions had always been savage and violent , to the extent they would often fight until they were exhausted , with no amount of intervention able to stop them once they began , you really did just have to let it take its course once that occurred . Anyone new to our dynamic would deduce that we 'd been heaped together for our abilities of huge strength and versatility , but in truth , when shit hits the fan , there are no two people i 'd rather have watching my back . <newline> <newline> 'were almost here ' I said . Partly because it was the truth , but mostly because if i had n't they would be at it each other in less than 30 seconds .

Us three piled out , with the car suspension finally being relieved with <<unk>> exit , returned to its original height . we entered through a metal door and into a vast expanse that does n't meet with regular architecture , as this space was much larger than what the outside should allow it to be . designed by <<unk>> <<unk>> , a man defined by the ministry as an architect , had built many of these creations with just his mind , many like him have been classified as architects , but his power stands above the rest , as he doesnt require raw materials or an original design to copy , he simply imagines it and it appears . nifty power , i thought . <newline> <newline> The ministry had always attempted to group and label abilities to better identify them , but because of the slight difference in each individuals they often fit into multiple areas , which is an administrative nightmare for their seers . a fancy name they call their paper pushers . Because just as they define a power , it is not uncommon to have that power never reappear , so in the end , there was no point . The powers that have never reappeared are what we call <<unk>> , as they are often incredibly powerful or useful . There have been only 7 recorded , with only 1 currently still being active . It belonged to the man who was the head of the Ministry , a man called <<unk>> John , an imposing man standing <<unk>> 5 , and with the incredible power to cancel , as in cancel anything he wanted , all he had to do was touch it , and it would vanish . with this power , he had ended all adversaries in their stance , and had brought peace to our world . But another power was quickly being considered as the 8th <<unk>> trait , the ability of complete mind , body and soul manipulation , and the one to possess this power , was yours truly . <newline> <newline> With this power , I would take Johns position and rule this world . i thought to myself <newline> <newline> <newline>

Well , it 's not the most usual line of work , and it does n't pay much , but I am definitely a whole lot happier than I was . It started at the absolute lowest point of my life . Actually , I think the day before the lowest , because the lowest was the next morning . On the day I tried to die , I was really depressed . <<unk>> depressed , it 's called . Every thought I had revolved around what a terrible person I was , how I deserved to die , how I wanted it to just end . I would think briefly how much happier people would be when I was gone , but I realise now that I actually barely thought about other people at all . I was basically mad with pain and not thinking straight , even if the pain was emotional rather than physical . <newline> <newline> So I jumped in front of a train . It was n't even a decision , not really . I was trying to get to my doctor and I suddenly could n't face the idea of telling someone who had been so blank the last time , what was going through my head now . It was my only way out , but it just seemed impossibly hard , and there was n't any future that was worth having . And then the tube was on its way in and I was jumping before I 'd even decided what to do next . <newline> <newline> It was like being smacked really hard into a giant speaker . It did n't hurt , not at first . Just this THUMP . And then I landed , and I thought this is it , I 'll land on the rails or get sliced up . But I sort of rolled under the train for quite a long time . I could smell oil and metal more than anything . I do n't remember seeing the driver . I 'm really , really sorry about the driver . I just was n't thinking at all , not about anything . I did n't know I was going to jump . I definitely did n't go there to jump . <newline> <newline> And then I lay there for a really long time , and the physical pain started , and you know what ? I felt a lot better . I really hurt , physically , all over . It made the endless thoughts finally shut up for a while . I was thinking this is it , I am dying . I could n't smell any blood , or really feel anything either , other than that I was hurt . I was just lying there while people moved around , cleared the platform , rolled the train forward . <newline> <newline> The other passengers were really angry and upset . I could n't make out words , but they did n't sound happy . I should have gone for paracetamol , except I did n't actually plan to kill myself at all . It just sort of happened . Anyway , the lights came back on and I had police looking down at me . I was blinking in the lights and one of the men swore and then went and threw up . It really stank . Another man kneeled down and asked if I could hear him , and I said yes , and a woman was talking into her radio , but I could n't make it out . The police man told me not to move . And eventually paramedics came and put me in an ambulance . They made me not look at anything . All I could see was yellow blocks either side of my head , and this woman 's face , a paramedic , telling me I was going to be okay . I met her again later on and I did n't recognise her until she said hello , and then I burst out crying . It was really embarrassing , for all different reasons . <newline> <newline> Anyway , the rest is all in the news , if you want to look . I made a miracle recovery , and now you ca n't tell anything had ever happened . I did get to see a psychiatrist without a referral . Most people were really good about it . I just felt so awful about what I 'd done to everyone and how much time I 'd wasted . I got lots of post , but nobody would let me read most of it . I got a lot of hate mail and threats , and my parents got it too . Dad was shouting at me how I was ruining things for him and mum , how they were going to have to move and it was all my fault , and then some nurses came in and he left and I did n't see him again , or mum , or anyone really . Mum sent me a card , but I did n't reply and she did n't send another . <newline> <newline> Anyway , I was back on my feet with all my arms and legs and everything back after twenty four hours , and I thought fuck . I 'm back exactly where I was before . I got really high off the morphine until they realised what was going on and I could n't have any more , and I missed it . I missed not feeling anything and not giving a damn . And I spent a while in a loony bin , which was n't as bad as I thought it would be , even with all the nutters . It was mostly really boring . I talked about what had happened and after
It all started with a new job . My mother had been a good girl . We shared some of her favorite songs and played with her favorite songs . We were happy . The only time we had been on that job was on an airplane in a small room . I was in a little too much room to be alone . It was a nice little room and I was in a small room , with a large table and a window . It was nice , and I was n't sure why . It was n't long before I saw the room and I was n't sure I was still in the room . I was very confused , and I looked at the table and I realized I had no clue what it meant . It was all over , and I was in the room . I was scared , but not scared . I was scared . I was scared . I did n't know what to do . I could n't believe it . I was scared , and I was scared . I did n't know how much longer I could
I had been in a small town for the better part of my life . My parents , my grandparents and the other kids were n't even there anymore . I had just moved in in my living room with my parents , but I had been in that little town for over a year . <newline> <newline> My parents had been on a camping trip for a while , but it was the only place I could afford to stay . I had been out on the road for a few days and was n't exactly sure how I was here . I was still in that little town , and the town was n't quite as big as I imagined . There was a lot of things I did n't want to be here . <newline> <newline> I had just gotten here , and I did n't want to be here . I was going to die . I had to die . I had to die . I wanted to die . I wanted to die . <newline> <newline> But the people around me were getting suspicious . I had been in a town where I was
`` No , not at all . '' <newline> <newline> `` Not at all ? What do you mean ? '' <newline> <newline> `` I mean the whole Bible , totally wrong . Old Testament , New Testament , <<unk>> , <<unk>> , '' God ranted , his aggravation clearly expressed in wild gesticulations , `` And all the more modern interpretations that have come out of spiritual <<unk>> <<unk>> the ravings of cult leaders and schizophrenics . All completely bonkers ! '' He softened after a moment and brought a hand up to stroke his beard . `` A few of them have gotten close though , '' he mused . `` It 's funny , really . Science gives me less and less places to hide , and so do the faithful , and they 're both wrong . '' He sighed a small chuckle and wistfully gazed out across the landscape . <newline> <newline> All of a sudden he seemed deep in thought , and I forgotten . I hesitated to break the silence , yet as I tried to remain patient I wondered awkwardly how long it might take until a god broke their own silence . It could be forever . On the other hand , I did n't appear to have anything else to do , or anywhere else to go . Truly , this is what being dead felt like . <newline> <newline> `` So , what 's your best guess then ? '' God spoke in the direction he gazed before turning to look back at me . `` I 'll tell you how close you get . '' <newline> <newline> My awkwardness was now compounded tenfold . `` I , er , have n't really given it much thought . '' <newline> <newline> `` Well we have all the time in the world . Or out of the world . Just give it your best , that 's all I ask . '' <newline> <newline> `` Ok , but wait . '' God raised his eyebrows indulgently , a small smile on his face . `` If everyone has always been wrong , does that mean that whatever answer I can come up with will be wrong too ? Is it possible to be right ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Not at all . People have described me before as being ineffable . Which , as the logic follows , means that I can , in fact , be <<unk>> . It 's just that no one has hit the nose yet . '' <newline> <newline> `` Ok , '' I mumbled , and tried to muster some confidence . Then I had another question . `` What about when people refer to you metaphorically , does that count ? '' <newline> <newline> `` If we 're thinking of the same thing then no . Much too vague . '' <newline> <newline> `` Ok . Interesting , '' I drew myself up , to convince myself more than He . `` So , if , if everyone has always been wrong about you , that would mean that you 're neither all-powerful nor <<unk>> , and the same with your omniscience . You are not the Creator , nor do you comprise some essence of the universe , you do not represent truth or goodness , nor do you have any special covenant with man . Oh , wait , that means you did not make us in your image either . So why do I see you like that ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Ah , there 's a trick to that but I 'm not giving you any hints . '' <newline> <newline> `` Oh . Ah , you mean , you did not make us , someone else did . And they made us in your image . Which would explain Jesus not being your son either . '' <newline> <newline> `` Hm , you are clever . Go on . '' <newline> <newline> `` No , I think I 've got it . '' <newline> <newline> `` My my ! Slow starter but clearly not just a pretty face ! '' <newline> <newline> `` Well it all came together when I remembered Acts <<unk>> , which says : <<unk>> is He served by human hands , as though He needed anything , since He Himself gives to all people life and breath and all things . '** I mean the second part is clear enough , just look at the world as it is , it 's pretty miserable . But the first part would mean that you are served by us , and you do *need* something . So , taking everything else together , here 's my idea . '' <newline> <newline> `` Yes , I 'm listening . '' <newline> <newline> `` The Universe was created for you by someone else , and all of the things inside it as well . You were placed here , and left alone , which means that you are all-powerful here but that 's only relative because it 's your universe and whoever created it for you is actually more powerful but they 're not here . Furthermore , they gave you the Earth and humanity in your image and left you alone to care for us . You do n't have a covenant with us , but you are beholden to the one that put you here . My Lord , you are *doing time* ! '' <newline> <newline> God 's lips were pressed together in a grim expression , his eyes narrow and hooded . I hesitated to continue , but realised that really , I had nothing to lose . <newline> <newline> `` The universe is your prison . You have to take care of us , for how long I do n't know . Maybe forever , as long as forever lasts here
I 'm not sure where I am . It 's been a long time since I 've seen a person , but I 'm not sure if it 's a man , or if it 's a man , or if this is what you call a man . <newline> I do n't know why I 'm here but it 's not the same man . It 's not a man . I do n't know what it is but I know what it 's saying . <newline> I 'm a human . I 'm not sure that I 'm God . I do n't know why I 'm here , I 'm not sure .

It was a long and arduous journey . A short walk , a walk that would be all the way through . I had no choice but to follow this path . <newline> <newline> I walked through the gates . The sun was just beginning to rise , and I could feel the heat rising in the air . It was not the first time I had been here in the past , but I was n't sure what I was going to say . <newline> The gates had been closed for years , but the sun was still setting . The sun was starting to rise , and I knew that the sun would be over . But it did n't . I knew that it would be over soon . <newline> <newline> I reached the door . It was too late . I had already passed through it , but I could n't leave . I knew that I could n't leave . <newline> <newline> I walked to the end of the path , and saw nothing . <newline>

I knelt behind the <<unk>> bushes and listened . <newline> <newline> The river was loud , but despite the cacophony of waters slamming on rocks , I could hear their chit-chat and laughs . I crept closer , always as silent as possible . I pushed some branches aside , and then I saw them . <newline> <newline> The river made a small pool around a small slope that resembled a tiny waterfall . Four maidens were bathing there , each more beautiful than the last . But she , Artemis , stood out . Easily . <newline> <newline> Her golden hair waved down on her shoulders as perfectly as the river itself , and reaching her ripen bosom . Her laughter was like a nightingale song . Her eyes seemed like Zeus himself had plucked out the Moon , doubled her , and placed her in Artemis ' face . <newline> <newline> The three Nymphs that surrounded her were of an equal blinding beauty for a mortal , but not for the likes of Artemis and myself . <newline> <newline> All four were laughing to a joke one of the Nymphs was saying . They had n't noticed me . Nor did they see me when I drew out my bow and arrow . When I took aim right at Artemis ' breast . When I shot . Only when the arrow hit her , they realised what was happening . They panicked . <newline> <newline> Golden ichor sprout out of her wound and mouth . The Nymphs were screaming . <newline> <newline> I ran away . She 's my fourth god to kill in this Pantheon . <newline> <newline> See , it 's not that difficult to infiltrate a Pantheon . Humans love adding more and more deities to their pantheons , or love expanding the fields one deity dominates , over a vast array of different fields . <newline> <newline> My name is Apollyon . All I needed to do was kill Apollo first and take his place . Apollo was also known as Apollyon , thus it was n't difficult to replace him , at least in the subjects we both represented : destruction . <newline> <newline> Back in the old days , one religion to dominate over another and completely eradicate the former one was virtually impossible . While it may have happened , traces of the original religion stood out , because the old gods never truly died . <newline> <newline> But a slight mistake from some <<unk>> bastards made me and my associates quite lucky , for the <<unk>> bough is easy to locate and even easier to make into <<unk>> arrows . <newline> <newline> Next stop : Olympus . Zeus , here I come .
God was in my house . The last thing he needed was to be in his house . But I did n't care . I was in my house . It was a strange house , but I did n't care . I did n't care for the gods . I did n't care for the gods . I did n't care when I was born , or even what I had . I did n't care because I was born to the gods . <newline> <newline> I was born to the god , and I was born to the god . <newline> <newline> I did n't care to get into the god , but I was born to the god . I was born to the god , but I still had to be born to the god . And I was born in the god 's house . <newline> <newline> I had a few gods and a few god gods . There were many gods who had a few gods , and they were a few god gods . I was born to the god who was in the god 's house , and he was n't the
`` This is it . '' <newline> <newline> I was n't even sure that I was going to be the first to be given the chance to be the first person to ever be given a chance to be given as the first human being on earth . I was just an average person with nothing to live for . I had no idea how I 'd gotten in my way and I was n't going to waste my time on this planet . I was just an average person . <newline> <newline> `` So , what do you think of the end of the world ? '' <newline> <newline> I looked around , looking for the source of this sound . I knew it would n't come to me . I had never heard of the end of the world . I never thought I would be the only one with such a chance . I was going to be the first to go to hell , but I had never thought I would be the first . <newline> <newline> `` Well , '' I began before I could even finish the sentence . `` You 're the first
Gravity lives next door . He is a quiet , practical guy , and he gets along with pretty much everyone although he is n't that much of a social butterfly . That 's why it 's his house that always gets picked out for throwing parties when the Laws of <<unk>> , as we call them now . Pronounced as something between lawn and <<unk>> . <<unk>> are like celebrities . Everyone knows them . The <<unk>> love people <<unk>> generally tend to love the whole world . It seems they love anything that they 're related to . Lots of people want to be freed from Death , and maybe Bodily Needs and a little bit of Gravity too , but no one can dare ask it . They 're too scared of what kind of reaction they might show when they know we sometimes do n't want to be connected . <newline> <newline> They say get along with your neighbors . Well , I 'm proud to say I do . I 'm good friends with <<unk>> get along , we enjoy each other 's prescence . I baked him cookies , he likes it , he shows me some cool tricks controlling Gravity as he will , and I like it . Gravity is pretty lenient , so he does n't mind letting your hand <<unk>> your <<unk>> it 's for a short while . He would never completely let go , and it 's only temporary , but floating *is* a lot of fun . Friends as we are , I guess it was only a matter of time before he invited me to one of his <<unk>> only parties . <newline> <newline> I hear a knock at the door and rush out . <newline> <newline> `` <<unk>> ... Oh , hey ! If it is n't good old <<unk>> . What 's up ? '' <newline> <newline> `` I 'm having a party tonight , with all the <<unk>> . Thought I 'd ask you . '' <newline> <newline> `` Ohhh ! I would be glad to go . Thank you for inviting me ! Will Reproduction be there ? '' <newline> <newline> Reproduction really is a celebrity , with beauty that can be sexual *and* purely aesthetic . I 've only seen Reproduction on screen , and I was n't about to pass up the chance . Gravity chuckled a little . <newline> <newline> `` Yeah , Reproduction 's coming . Well , see you then . '' <newline> <newline> Yes ! I muffled an elated squeal . I could n't wait ! <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> Oh my god . I thought with half giggles and half grim repentance . Just how drunk am I ? I muttered as the world made a backflip in front of me . Addiction was a sly boy , though I had to admit he was pretty cute . Oh well , at least I turned down the marijuana . <newline> <newline> I <<unk>> the table , looking for more alcohol to drench my body in . But I could n't make it . Death was right there , in all her glory ! She was just like what I heard . Fiery red hair , curvaceous body , shining green eyes . She was one attractive lady . I recalled learning that before <<unk>> took on the human form , Death was perceived as some skeleton , dressed in black and holding a scythe . I could n't understand how anyone could think that way . Death was full of love . She loved everyone , perhaps to the point where it was too much and she got possessive . But she was vibrant with love and confidence bordering on arrogance . How could anyone think Death would wear black ? I took a step towards her , wanting to talk . <newline> <newline> I then noticed that Death was n't just enjoying the party . She was having an argument with Life and Inertia . I hesitated , not wanting to get caught up in a fight . Too late , Death turned towards me with tears in her eyes . She told Life and Inertia , `` Let 's ask a human then . Let 's ask what *they* think ! '' . She then asked with remarkable force , `` Life and Inertia says that I should n't exist and no one likes me . They tell me I 'm a bother . Are n't they so mean ? How could they ! I 'm a Law , just like they are ! Dying is a natural order too , <<unk>> ? '' <newline> <newline> I spewed a bit of meaningless garble before my brain cleared enough to pronounce understandable sentences . <newline> <newline> `` Well , uhhh , but it is only natural that people do n't want to , ummm , die . I mean , I do n't mean that I do n't like you ! I really like you , you 're a very beautiful person , and uh , really nice . But , you know ... Some people dread death . '' <newline> <newline> Unfortunately , my alcohol ridden brain was n't clear enough for good judgement . Death pushed me back *hard* , sending me staggering a few steps back . When I regained balance , I could see Life and Inertia clicking their tongues at Death behind her shoulder . Death , meanwhile , pushed back her tears and pointed her long index finger at me . <newline> <newline> `` Fine ! If you do n't like me , then do whatever you want ! I-I do n't like you either ! I wo n't *ever* take you ! '' <newline> <newline> Then she left , stomping up a storm as she walked away . My fuzzy brain could n't quite comprehend what
I was in the middle of the forest , in the middle . I could see the forest behind me , the trees that were a few feet away . It was a beautiful thing , the trees that were a bit too thin , and the tree that was a little too thin . <newline> <newline> It was a beautiful thing , a beautiful thing . It was a beautiful thing , a beautiful thing . <newline> <newline> I was in the middle , and I was in the middle , and it was beautiful . <newline> <newline> I was in the middle .

Doctor Malachi <<unk>> took his little pen light and shined it in my left eye . Then my right eye . Then the left again . <newline> <newline> `` Hmm ? '' was all he said . <newline> <newline> `` Anything , Doc ? '' I said as he continued his efforts to blind me one eye at a time . <newline> <newline> `` Follow the light with your eyes . '' He took the little light , started at the edge of my vision on my right and moved the tiny light slowly to the left - a tiny Sun looking to illuminate a problem . Any problem . <newline> <newline> God , please let me have some problem with my eyes . <newline> <newline> When the little light reached the end of it 's day and came at last to as far as my eyes could go left , Dr <<unk>> turned his tiny torch off and sat back in his chair . <newline> <newline> He stared at me over the half lenses of his reading glasses . He knew me well enough to know that I was deeply bothered by something . <newline> <newline> `` Nothing wrong with your eyes Paul . '' He said . <newline> <newline> *Well , that just means I 'm crazy then* , I thought . <newline> <newline> I heard his chair roll forward and then found a lolly pop placed into my open palm - I had n't even realised I had just sat and looked at them , my hands , after he 'd given me the all clear . Dr <<unk>> always gave me a lolly pop after a check up . He 'd been my doctor since I was six . <newline> <newline> *Could be something wrong with my brain . Something neurological ? * I thought . <newline> <newline> The kindly old Doctor patted me on the knee and said `` Paul ? What 's the matter ? '' <newline> <newline> I looked up at him . He was wavy and blurred through the tears that filled my eyes , but I could still make out the tiny horns atop his head . <newline> <newline> Dr Malachi <<unk>> was a short , grey bearded man , with <<unk>> eyeglasses perpetually stuck half way down his thin beak-like nose . He was not a Satyr , a half man half goat , but that is what I saw him as now . <newline> <newline> Two tiny horns peaked out from his greying , dark , <<unk>> like hair . Instead of pants he wore furry goats legs . On his feet were hooves , not shoes . His shirt with it 's rolled up sleeves and his gaudy horrible tie were the same as ever . <newline> <newline> `` It 's nothing , Doc . '' I stood up , shook his hand and walked out of his office before he could object . The waiting room of the small practice was filled with an encyclopaedia of mythology . A tiny gargoyle , maybe a little boy , complained to a large pile of rocks that he was bored . The rocks passed the boy a smart phone and said in an entirely too feminine voice for a pile of rubble : `` Please do n't waste all of Mummy 's battery . <newline> <newline> There were winged things , slug things , people with animal traits , and animals with people traits . <newline> <newline> I left the small building , a converted house , and walked with quick long steps to my car . As I pulled away I looked back into the building through the tall glass windows at it 's front and saw Dr <<unk>> . He stood , his legs all furry with hair , in the doorway to his office , a look of concern on his face as he watched me drive away . <newline> <newline> *** <newline> <newline> I had awoken that day and started it like any other : a bowl of sugary cereal and a half hour of early morning TV . I watched the news these days . I did n't really care about global events , which I some times felt guilty about , but I was n't giving up the sugary cereal and had decided I needed to do something to at least act like I had lived my twenty eight years . So I kept the sugar and swapped out the cartoons . <newline> <newline> There was the same news team I always watched , spread out on couches to show how casual and friendly they were . They would laugh and joke . Apparently , behind the scenes , they all hated each other . <newline> <newline> That fact made the show almost worth watching . I had waited and waited for one of them to snap , live on camera . <newline> <newline> Instead , I had snapped . <newline> <newline> Where I had expected people on couches , I saw creatures . The sports guy was a horned and heavy bull like biped - a minotaur ? - and the lead female anchor was a mermaid , her scaly tail flopped in the cool dry studio air . <newline> <newline> Those are some good costumes . Why are n't they bringing them up ? They are *really* good costumes . <newline> <newline> These had been the thoughts that went through my head . <newline> <newline> When I had stepped outside to make my way to my office my neighbours had worn similar disguises as they drove off to work . I ran back inside . The mirror showed a confused human man . No animal parts . <newline> <newline> Then I went and saw Dr <<unk>> . <newline> <newline> * * * <newline> <newline> My time with the doctor had been unfruitful and so I had come back home and gone

The light flickered , the light was fading , and it had begun to fade . The light was becoming darker , and the light came out of the darkness . <newline> <newline> It was as if everything was in a dream , and the light was coming back . But , the darkness was coming , and all around me , the darkness was fading , and the light was becoming darker , and a bright light was coming out of the darkness . <newline> <newline> A young man sat in front of a large man , dressed in a dark black coat , and a dark blue cloak .

Something kept poking at Palpatine 's mind ; something was calling to him . It had kept him up for days at a time , and was slowly starting to interfere with his grand plans concerning Order 66 . Something had altered the balance of the Force , something that ascended the matters of Sith and Jedi . <newline> <newline> `` Master , the <<unk>> have told us that the inhibitor chips in the Clones are ready to be activated at will . '' said the voice of apprentice Darth Vader . `` Master ? Something disturbs you , what is it ? '' <newline> <newline> `` A disturbance in the Force , Anakin . Someone has achieved a promising sign of power . A rival to your power . '' responded Palpatine , who was now formulating a plan to test his dark apprentice even further . <newline> <newline> `` Who is it my Lord ? Master Yoda ? Obi-Wan ? '' the voice of Anakin was filling with hate and anger , he could not comprehend that someone was able to compete with his level of power . Nor did he want to accept it . <newline> <newline> `` Yes , let the hate flow through you , Anakin . '' said Palpatine as he cynically started cackling . `` A Jedi Knight who has left the order ; he has achieved a balance of both light and dark within himself . Such power , such control has never been seen before . It must be stopped . '' <newline> <newline> `` Of course my Lord , I shall leave immediately . Where is this Jedi ? '' <newline> <newline> `` No , Lord Vader . You shall not leave today . '' said Palpatine , purposefully adding a pause to rile up the negative feelings in his apprentice . `` The 501st is slated to storm the Jedi Temple , they will dispose of this self proclaimed Grey Jedi . '' <newline> <newline> `` My Lord , this is outrageous . The clones are tasked with something that you even admit is a rival to **my <<unk>> ? I could destroy the entire temple by myself ! You can not hold me back ! '' <newline> <newline> `` Excellent , Anakin , excellent ! The hate flows through you , I feel it . You are ready ; join the 501st tomorrow and kill this grey Jedi , kill all the Jedi you encounter on your way to him as well . '' with his plan to rile up Darth Vader complete , Palpatine threw his head back into a wicked crackle and proceeded to stare out his window upon the city of Coruscant . <newline> <newline> -- <newline> & nbsp ; <newline> Darth Vader and the 501st stormed the Jedi Temple , shooting and slicing down all who crossed their path . Lord Vader let his hatred flow through his body and grow with each kill he gained ; he was determined to silence any and all competition to his spot as apprentice to Palpatine . <newline> <newline> `` Break formation and catch any stragglers . Go . '' the command was simple , yet Vader still thought he placed too much trust in the clones for such a big task . `` I will find you Grey Jedi , show yourself . '' shouting , and sprinting around the temple , Vader continued to slay Jedi until he could focus on his target . <newline> <newline> `` Lord Vader , or should I say Anakin Skywalker , traitor to the galaxy ? '' said a voice from behind the Jedi Library . `` I am the Grey Jedi you search for . I am Master Ram Dar . '' <newline> <newline> Vader was not expecting a young man , no older than twenty , brandishing a newly forged yellow Lightsaber in a defensive position . `` You die today , Ram Dar . The Sith show no mercy to any type of Jedi . '' <newline> <newline> `` So be it . Your angry flows through you , as does mine , but you can not control it ; you have let your anger blind you , I have let mine guide me . <newline> <newline> Vader had enough of the <<unk>> talk and force sprinted towards Ram Dar at an incredible speed pounding his lightsaber across his multiple times : to Vader 's surprise , Ram Dar was able to keep up to pace with the strikes . <<unk>> overhead with a force charged front flip , Ram Dar used the force to push Vader on the ground . Vader leapt back up and continued with the offensive blows while Ram Dar used a defensive style . Vader grew quickly tired of this and started pouring his anger into his blows , his eyes turning into a familiar orange , a sign of a Sith . Ram Dar noting the charge of negative energy switched to an offensive fighting style to combat the power shift , but Ram Dar 's offensive blows could not match those of Vader . <newline> <newline> `` You tap into the Dark Side for power , very clever . Yet you use the Light Side to remain in your oh so elegant form . How proper of you . '' mocked Vader `` But let 's end this- '' interrupted by a force choke being performed by Ram Dar , Vader found himself being choked significantly , the air escaping his lungs and his breath rapidly fainting . <newline> <newline> `` Yes , Vader , let us end this . '' said Ram Dar as he tightened his grip , now walking himself and Vader to a nearby wall to finish the act . As Vader was pressed against the wall an explosion could be heard in the distance , knowing this was the clones all Vader had to
The first few years of this had been a whirlwind of chaos and chaos . The first few years were a slow one , but for the first few years , the first few years were a disaster . <newline> The second few years , when it came to the <unk> , the <unk> was no longer an issue . The <unk> was nothing but a shadow of a man that had no life left to say . <newline> The second week , the <unk> had been called into a war .

`` My client pleads solipsism '' , I said to the jury ( whom I had bribed liberally with <<unk>> before the trial ) . <newline> <newline> `` Adolf Hitler was just another idiot who thought reality was just a dream and that killing millions of people in a dream would n't matter . '' I wiped my forehead with my kitten skin handkerchief - the air-conditioning in the purgatory courtrooms never seems to work . <newline> <newline> I turned to the judge defensive and dramatically shouted `` And you , God , of all people try to accuse this poor man , my sweet innocent client of genocide - well *you* better send *yourself* to Hell then , because *you* created this motherfucker . Omnipotent ? Omnipotent my ass ! ! ! Rather impotent ! ! ! God , if you are omnipotent you should have known that creating a fucked up motherfucker like Hitler would fuck shit up for human kind - but nooooo - you had to go play with your organic chemistry set again and produce this monster , I mean , the ... sweet ... innocent monster that is my momma 's boy of a client . '' I spit on the courtroom floor so that I can look badass but immediately regret it when I see my own spit and feel disgusted . I take a seat and have a little silent giggle because I 've never quite gotten over the hilarity of talking to a burning bush with one of those weird white judges ' wigs on top of it . <newline> <newline> About six hours of playing cellphone games under the table later I am called to make my closing statement . <newline> <newline> I get up and start puffing myself up like a <<unk>> so I can deliver my speech `` ... .and that is why , God , you should put your head through that stupid loophole in your system and hang yourself by it !

`` I 'm sorry about your actions , but you have to be careful . '' <newline> <newline> <newline> I looked around the room , and I was sure I was being mistaken and I had to be in the middle of a trial . This was my case , and this was it . If it was n't for the fact that I had to be in a lawyer , I would n't be in the middle of the trial for the next week . <newline> <newline> <newline> `` You 're not a lawyer , do you ?

`` This is your first attempt at a story , '' the man behind the podium said . <newline> <newline> `` I 'm sorry , '' I said . <newline> <newline> `` I 'm sorry , '' I said , as I put a hand on the podium and started to sob . <newline> <newline> `` And you 'll do well to keep this up , '' he said . <newline> <newline> `` I 'm sorry , '' I said . <newline> <newline> `` This is my last chance , '' I said . <newline> <newline> `` This is my last chance , '' he said , and he began to sob . <newline> <newline> `` I know , '' I said , and began to speak . <newline> <newline> `` I am sorry , '' he said . <newline> <newline> `` This is your last chance , '' I said , as I held my hands up to my forehead with my hands . <newline> <newline> `` This is my last chance , '' he said . <newline> <newline> `` This is my last chance .

They were in the middle of a war , the war was over , and their war was over . <newline> <newline> The President had been elected president , and he was elected president . The people of the room were in shock at the sudden change of tactics , the people that were the first to vote for the President , he had never been elected president , and he was a <unk> . <newline> <newline> The President was a tall man , and was a tall man . The President stood in front of the President , the President , and asked if he could take off his suit for the first time in his life . <newline> <newline> The President stood up , and said `` No , '' and said `` Do n't worry , I am the last man . '' <newline> <newline> The President took a step forward , and said `` No , the President is right , I 'm the last man . '' <newline> <newline> The President looked at the President , and said `` I was the last man , and that 's the thing about a new president .
`` How can mirrors be real , if our eyes are n't real ? '' Jaden speaks slowly , his tone serious , as his eyes make contact first with Taylor , and then with Kanye . He sets the card printed with his tweet upon the podium . `` Taylor , you have five minutes to answer . '' <newline> <newline> `` Well , '' Taylor smiles and pulls a wave of blond hair behind her ear , her eyes scanning the audience with nervousness , `` I think , we , as a country , do need to look in the mirror -- '' <newline> <newline> `` I'mma let you finish , '' Kanye interjected . `` But I think it needs to be said that I have the greatest vision for this country , the greatest vision of all time . And mirrors , they 're real , and so are our eyes , what is this shit question about ? '' <newline> <newline> A buzzer suddenly goes off , drowning out Kanye , and the timer above the stage has stopped . Jaden raises his hand from the buzzer as Kanye folds his arms and pouts . <newline> <newline> `` I do n't have time for this , '' Kanye throws his arms up and walks off stage . A din of confusion arises from the audience and begins to build , louder , and some of the crowd begins to leave while others chant `` Taylor ! Taylor ! '' and then those dressed in knock off Yeezy ( as none could afford the actual brand and no one can tell the difference from garage sale distressed 90s grunge wear ) begin to push back , arguments and tempers flare across the room . <newline> <newline> Taylor bites her lip , takes her mic off the stand and heads toward center stage . `` The haters gon na hate , hate , hate , hate , hate -- '' she starts to go in to her hit , the sound guy takes cue and sets the music playing . <newline> <newline> For a moment , the crowd looks over , and the Taylor fans cheer , but this only angers the Kanye crew . <newline> <newline> Jaden knew what must be done . <newline> <newline> Without a word , he heads back stage . `` Kanye , '' he calls out . A shadow stands in a bright doorway , the rear exit off the studio . The name echoes down the hall . <newline> <newline> `` Will you hate ? Or for this country 's sake , can you shake ? '' Jaden 's silver make up and chrome skirt reminded Kanye of early 2000s TLC and Destiny 's Child , a Beyonce that inspired him . <newline> <newline> The roar of the crowd reached Kanye 's ears . <newline> <newline> `` Only you can improve this situation , '' Jaden said . <newline> <newline> `` I will freestyle the next verse , '' he agreed , and headed back toward the stage . <newline> <newline> When the crowd saw him , the Taylor fans shrieked in anger , their white faces turning red from madness . The Kanye fans were invigorated . The whole place was prepared for a riot . <newline> <newline> Taylor sang the chorus with heart and soul , then , tossed Kanye the microphone . He began to rap . <newline> <newline> The fans , moved by Taylor 's gesture , the beat , the chorus , began to feel the music . Cries of , `` let 's dance , let 's stop fighting ! '' were heard across the room . <newline> <newline> His words captured the spirit of Taylor 's work , spinning them in to a form palatable to the tastes of his fans . A new appreciation for pop , elevated by their hip hop god , took root in their minds , and they , too , began to shake . <newline> <newline> Soon , everyone was dancing . The riot had been averted . <newline> <newline> Jaden took the podium once more . `` Who says we ca n't have two presidents ? '' <newline> <newline> The crowd cheered .
`` Mr. President ! Mr. President , it 's not a good idea . '' <newline> <newline> `` No , '' Mr. President replied , `` No , I 'm sorry , Mr. President . I 'm sorry , Mr. President .

I 'm sorry , Mr. President . Mr. President , this is not something you can do for me . '' <newline> <newline> `` Mr. President , it 's not what we need , Mr. President . I 'm sorry , Mr. President . It 's what we need . '' <newline> <newline> `` Mr. President , this is not a bad idea . It is a problem . '' <newline> <newline> `` Mr. President , that is not a bad idea , Mr. President .

`` Dr. Edmunds , something interesting came up on the latest screen , '' stated Johannes , the tremor in his voice betraying a cautious optimism . <newline> <newline> `` This better be good . My grant proposal is due Friday , '' stated Edmunds , finally tearing her gaze away from the monitor and to Johannes . He quickly glanced at the ground , concealing his surprise . Edmunds appeared more pale and gaunt than usual . His face started to burn . Hardly anyone dared to enter Edmund 's office without scheduling an appointment . Luckily , Johannes ' appearance was bold enough to warrant her undivided attention . She noticed he was in an unusual state of disarray , hair greasy and <<unk>> suit wrinkled . He must have been working double shifts . <newline> <newline> `` I-If this is what I think it is , you 'll have every big pharma company coming to *you* with the money , '' Johannes replied . `` I repeated this experiment three times , always in <<unk>> . Data is statistically significant at a <<unk>> of 0.0001 . In other words , there is a 0.01 % chance that it is due to random variation , and -- '' <newline> <newline> `` Let me see , '' she interrupted . Johannes passed her the sheets of data . Edmunds sat up straighter and leaned forward , brows knit in inquisitive concern as her eyes darted across the numbers . <newline> <newline> Sample 1215 : at long last , a positive hit . <newline> <newline> A rare smile slowly crept unto Edmund 's face , then suddenly burst into an ear-to-ear grin . Eyes shining , she said , `` We spent five years at the edge of this colony , hoping in vain to find some new compound as a therapeutic agent to combat the cancer on Earth ... . '' here , a hand flitted across her chest and rested across her heart . She coughed violently , spasms rocking her thin body as another hand covered her mouth . Pulling away , spots of blood were seen . She hastily wiped her hand off on a handkerchief . There were n't many unstained areas left on the fabric . The familiar dull throbbing pain returned to her chest . <newline> <newline> Johannes offered her water , which she gratefully sipped . After a pause , she continued . `` We took a risk being here . They said we could n't find anything by the mines . But that ended up being our advantage . What was Sample 1215 ? '' <newline> <newline> Johannes could no longer contain his once cautious excitement . `` Sample 1215 was one of few organic compounds found from the soil dug up in the mines . There is life down there , likely bacterial in origin , and it is producing this compound in great quantities . Mass spec data revealed a unique <<unk>> sequence found nowhere on Earth , though there is some <<unk>> to <<unk>> soil bacterial proteins , '' he paused to take a breath -- oxygen content is lower inside the Mars facility compared to Earth . `` When given to cancer cells *in <<unk>> , it killed nearly all of them while not harming <<unk>> cells . In the animal model , this compound appears to stop <<unk>> . In other words , in addition to its <<unk>> <<unk>> , it prevents blood vessel growth to the tumor . '' <newline> <newline> Edmunds slowly stood , smile unwavering . `` You have made a remarkable discovery , Johannes . You will finally be able to graduate with your Ph.D. , with nothing less than the highest honors . '' <newline> <newline> `` Thank you , Dr. Edmunds . Without your direction , this would n't have been possible , '' Johannes replied , bowing his head . A shadow crept over his face . There was a hesitating silence before he continued . `` I ... I knew about your condition all along . The cancer you tried to keep secret . The same cancer afflicting most of the population on Earth . The way you are now ... .There is n't much time . '' <newline> <newline> Edmunds nodded slowly in agreement . It was foolish of her to think the others would n't have noticed by now . <newline> <newline> `` I can give you the first treatment , '' Johannes said , looking up to meet Edmunds ' eyes . `` It might give you more time . Enough to see that we take it home over the years . '' <newline> <newline> Her eyes looked past Johannes towards the window , beyond the red terrain and into the sky . `` Yes , I would like that very much . But that ca n't be the focus now . I did n't tell anyone this , but there 's only going to be one more trip from the Colony to go home . Back on Earth , people have given up so much hope that they do n't want to allocate anymore resources to us . The grant I have been writing was for a separate project that can be done on Earth . '' <newline> <newline> `` What ? ! '' Johannes blurted loudly . `` There is only one chance to take home a cure we only discovered this month ? For all of the people affected on Earth ? How can we manage that ? '' <newline> <newline> Edmunds sighed . The weariness she felt was not only physical . `` What we will do is find the organism producing Compound 1215 , and find out the conditions it best grows in . Then , we will see if we can mimic those conditions on Earth . If we can grow the bacteria on Earth , we can produce

When Justin Bieber came into the room , I was shocked and surprised . Nobody from my high school would ever have believed it . My icon , my dream , was singing to me ! <newline> <newline> That was a year ago . <newline> <newline> Since then , I 've had a string of celebrities from A to TMZ shuffle into my room to lift my spirits . If they wanted to lift my spirits , they 'd get me off this damn machine and to the nearest CVS to buy ear plugs . Just yesterday , I had to beg Dave <<unk>> to leave . If he had brought Stamos that would be a different story , but give me a fucking break . Dave <<unk>> ? What year is this ? <newline> <newline> So , anybody who cares to listen , I am begging you to have them stop . When I first told my mom , my dad , the doctors , that I had had enough , they thought I was being humble . Brave . The story got on the news . And more of them came . <newline> <newline> So this is it . <newline> <newline> They told me I ca n't be cured . They told me laughter is the best medicine . Well , I 'll laugh today when I look into Bono 's eyes and pull the plugs . <newline> <newline> Who knows ? It just might cure me .

I can feel their eyes on the back of my neck . Typical cowards , staring , but looking away whenever I turn my head . Why ca n't they just come out and ask ? <newline> <newline> Life has n't been easy . My first memories are cursing this dreaded dragon birthmark , which everyone assumed was a sign of power and destiny . Back then I was too meek to admit otherwise , going off the slay dragons and destroy undead without even being asked , because it was clearly expected of me . No more . <newline> <newline> I try to enjoy my drink ... watered down swill in a chipped glass , but can only focus on the mutterings of conversation behind me . I know they 're talking about it , trying to work up the nerve to ask me , the <<unk>> champion ' to save them from the barbarians to the west . Those idiots . The barbarians have no interest in attacking this miserable little village , but that wo n't stop them from quaking with fear , waiting for some grand hero to rescue them . <newline> <newline> The murmurings seem to grow louder . I ca n't make out the words , but I do n't need to . I can sense the growing desperation , and as much as I try to drown it out , it 's overwhelming . I rub at the accursed mark anxiously , trying to focus my thoughts of something , anything , but in the end I know it 's no use . '' <newline> <newline> `` Okay , fine ! '' I shout , rising to my feet . At last they avoid averting their gaze , and now watch me with expressions of feigned confusion . `` I 'll go slay your barbarians , if that 's what 's required for you to leave me alone ! By the Gods , what must a man do to earn a moments peace ? '' <newline> <newline> I storm out the door of the tavern , one of the patrons asking another 'what was that about ? ' . I 'm used to it by now , however . Wherever I go , it 's the same story . It would n't be so bad if people actually came out and asked for help , and spoke about the mark , rather than just pretending they did n't notice it . Oh well , off to another battlefield ... it may not be magical , but this dragon birthmark has brought me more misery than the darkest of curses .
My mind was racing . <newline> <newline> I 'm still here , in a hospital bed . It 's been 3 months since I was in the hospital . <newline> <newline> My body 's gone , now .

`` Come on , Ian , just do it . What , are you scared ? '' I turned and glared at Steven , who 'd been taunting me all night . Really , all of my friends had been taunting me . Steven had his arm around a young girl , Cindy , with a swirl of blonde hair pinned loose in a bun and a flowing sundress covered in scattered , white polka-dots . Leaning against a stop sign was a taller boy , beat up hoodie and jeans with dark , brown hair and even darker brown eyes . He watched us with amusement , waiting for my answer as I stalled , pretending to look for something in my car . I felt a tug on the back of my coat and turned to see two beautiful brown eyes peering up at me . <newline> <newline> `` Do n't be a chicken , Ian , '' those eyes make my stomach flutter and her voice clears my head of any intelligent thoughts . I shut the door behind me and take in the girl before me , Lucy , honey-colored hair draped around her shoulders , and a loose-fitting sweater over tight jeans . We 'd been playing some kind of <<unk>> game for a few weeks now and of course , Steven invited her along to try and bend me to his will in some way . Only now did I see in what way . <newline> <newline> `` I 'm really not sure I want to spend the night in the old abandoned hospital , '' I mutter , tearing my gaze from hers to look up the hill at the decrepit building . The guy at the stop sign , Jake , shifted his weight and walked over to the rest of the group , patting my shoulder . <newline> <newline> `` It 'll be fine , Ian . The place is huge and we can just explore it all night . '' I brushed his hand away and avoided Lucy 's eyes , turning back to glare at Steven . <newline> <newline> `` What 's in it for me , man ? This is such bullshit . '' <newline> <newline> `` Oh , I do n't know , man , '' Steven answered , nodding toward Lucy . She glanced back at him and he looked up into the sky , feigning innocence and even whistling for effect . Lucy shook her head with a smirk and her eyes locked with mine and I knew my answer as much as I hated to admit it . As we began to trudge up the hill , we were joined by Jake 's younger sister , Emily . She looked excited to be included and while Jake greeted her and Cindy and Lucy stopped to chat together , Steven jogged over to my side , staring at the twisted , iron gate . `` This 'll be great , dude . You can score a little action with Lucy , man . It 's perfect ! '' <newline> <newline> `` I would n't call an old , empty hospital *perfect , * Steve , '' I sighed and watched her for a second before turning to study the hospital again . `` I always figured we 'd go on a date before we started breaking into buildings to do it ... '' <newline> <newline> `` Think of this as a date , Ian . I 'm sure there 'll be beds in here somewhere . Do n't be such a bitch , dude . Strap up , strap on , and let 's party . '' He laughed as Cindy approached him and wrapped an arm around her , pushing the gates open as I heard her asking what we 'd been talking about . <newline> <newline> `` Strap on ? What the ... '' <newline> <newline> `` Strap on , huh ? '' I jumped as Lucy 's voice sounded behind me . `` What 's that mean ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Uh , nothing ! Something Steve said . '' I rubbed my neck , hot with embarrassment while Lucy 's eyes flashed in the moonlight and a smile played on her lips . <newline> <newline> `` Well , if that 's what he 's into , I guess . C'mon , let 's catch up . '' She dashed around me and squeezed through the gap between the gate and I noticed everyone had moved ahead while we 'd had our short exchange . I looked up at the gate before passing through . *The old Arkham Mental Hospital ... Closed down fifty years ago once they investigated the place for abuse of the patients . Who knows what we 'll find <<unk>> A voice calling for me to hurry up interrupted my thought . <newline> <newline> `` What the hell ? '' I muttered before running to catch up to the group . Jake and Steven shoved into the front door , pushing all their weight to force it open as I arrived . The door ground against the floor of the foyer , sending a shower of dust into the air as it scraped against the tiles . We all squeezed through and Steven produced flashlights from a bag I had n't noticed him carrying . <newline> <newline> `` In case we decide to split up , we 'll each have a light . '' Steven passed them around and flicked his on , shining it under his chin to cast strange shadows over his face . `` Are we ready to descend into <<unk>> <<unk>> BELOW ... '' * He spoke with an inflection like Dracula , throwing his voice around the halls around us in a gloomy echo . <newline> <newline> `` Let 's just move on , dork , '' Cindy teased , shoving him
Time ! , to go back to school but something seems different ... everything is dank , and when I describe school it was nothing but dank . The teachers were dank , sitting in their dank offices , they always <<unk>> handed out the dankest homework . The students were acting surprisingly dank ; they were all happy be to around the dank classrooms and the dank campus . Even the dean had transformed into DANK DEAN ; a person we can all trust with out dankest dreams of being a dank person of society one day . <newline> <newline> My first class was extremely dank , maybe arguably the dankest class of my semester , or I guess I have n't experienced the whole dank semester yet , so I should judge a dankness on the freshness of the flavor ; I should see how it plays out a little more , but the teacher handed out some of the dankest homework I 've ever had . We just have to present a dank ass argument for a topic that we find <<unk>> engaging , which means we can look at any topic , as long as YOU find it dank . <newline> <newline> I ca n't wait for the rest of this dank school year ; It 's going to be dank .

I was n't sure how to explain it , but I had to know . I 'd had a lot of time in my life . I had a few months left , and I had a few years left , and I 'd just gone out at the same time . I did n't need to go out there , and I wanted to go home . <newline> <newline> I was n't sure how to explain it . I had n't expected to see anything . <newline> <newline> `` Hey , what 's up ? '' a voice said as I approached my door . <newline> <newline> I stepped out , and was greeted by a woman . She was n't a beautiful woman , but I knew her . <newline> <newline> `` What 's up ? '' I asked . <newline> <newline> `` I 'm sorry , but there must be something I need to tell you . '' <newline> <newline> `` What do you mean ? It 's ... it 's ... it 's ... it 's ... it 's ... it 's ... you 're ... you 're ... '' <newline> <newline> `` I 'm not
<<unk>> . Patron deity of creative destruction . He Who Reaches Both Near and Far . <newline> <newline> These are monikers given to me after I became a god . I was originally an archer who won several skirmishes using his sidearm . My ascension came upon felling an awakened demon by the letter of the legendary law , but not the spirit ; no one said I could n't use kamikaze squirrels , after all . <<unk>> my station , I was given a small pocket dimension by a quorum of the Pantheon . I used it as a canvas to express my divine portfolio . <newline> <newline> The sky is always blue during the day , and the full moon always out during the night . My pocket dimension has what I call the Infinite <<unk>> Meadow , with emerald grass and hills as far as the eyes can see . It is not infinite , of course , and the closed space will loop back . In the <<unk>> ' lies my maze fortress , lovingly called the <<unk>> . Half of it is an actual castle , with hidden passageways and everyone not bolted down can be used as a weapon . However , it can be difficult to tell where the architecture ends and nature begins . Taking cues from the elves , I 've blended the two . What would normally be a hall nexus would instead be a clearing . Groves are fed by brooks which , if someone were to turn into a fish or otter , lead to hidden treasure rooms and armories , and allow access to the fortress in ways that the hallways do not . <newline> <newline> After all , what kind of battle god would I be if I privileged only knights in full armor ? Rogues and clever <<unk>> need love too . <newline> <newline> People with longstanding grudges can put down artifacts and gold as collateral , and fight it out in my domain . I have found that death can make people cautious , but a `` no pain '' rule also encourages recklessness that suppresses creativity . While death is n't permanent unless they want it to be , I 've certainly amped up the pain quotient to keep things interesting . The Prime Material Plane seems to privilege mages who wield fire and lightning , as well as heroes with enchanted weapons . Again , I am the Patron Deity of Creative Destruction . Such tactical convergence and complacency are ill-suited to my playground . <newline> <newline> I also allow for spectators , who enjoy the floating grove fruits that I cultivate , as well as the entertainment . Why , last week there was one very interesting battle . One <<unk>> turned an archer into an oyster , then turned into an otter and <<unk>> them both through the waterways into the treasure room . Stumbling upon the rare Blast Arrows , they then waited until the mercs were directly above them before exploding everything down to the Bottomless Chasm , and sending the mercenaries to their doom . <newline> <newline> Had it not been for the <<unk>> turning into a giant spider , both of them would 've died . This tactic was certainly only possible due to their combined skills and daring . Exquisite ! They went home rich that day , while the knights spent a week in my Trap Labyrinth until they developed a better danger sense . <newline> <newline> Would you like to try your luck ?
I have a job with the best of intentions . <newline> <newline> I have a family , I have a girlfriend , my wife , and I can not go to my office in a matter of hours . I have a friend , and I have a family . <newline> <newline> I have a girlfriend . <newline> <newline> I have a girlfriend . <newline> <newline> The next day , I am sitting at the table , with a cup of coffee in hand . The table is empty , except for a table .

I had been in the office for a few hours , I had been in the elevator , I was in it , and then I heard it . <newline> <newline> The sound of the elevator , and the sound of the elevator , and the sound of the elevator , as I entered it , and I looked up , and saw that there was a woman standing at the other end of the room staring at me . She was dressed in black , with black hair , and a black hat . <newline> <newline> She looked at me . I looked into her eyes and said , `` I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry . '' <newline> <newline> `` Are you alright ? '' I asked . <newline> <newline> `` Yes , I 'm okay . '' <newline> <newline> `` I 'm sorry . '' <newline> <newline> She looked at me . `` Why are you here ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Well , '' I said , `` I was just thinking , '' she continued , `` I 'm just trying to find a way to ...

The lamp was in the middle of a desert , the sky was a bright red and the wind was blowing through the clouds . The lamp was still in its place , and the lamp was still in its place . The lamp was still in its place , and it was still warm , but still warm . I took a sip of my drink , and stared at it . <newline> <newline> “ This is not the first time . I 'm the first person to grant wishes , ” I said aloud . <newline> <newline> The lamp was still in its place , a large , black lamp . It was a lamp . It was the size of a human body , and it was a small , slender shape . The shape was a woman with a large , dark hair . She was wearing a long white coat , and her long dark hair was wrapped around her . She was tall , and her eyes were blue with tears . Her face was a deep brown , and she was looking into my eyes . She looked at me , and I
`` How young ? '' The genie asked , perplexed by my decision . <newline> <newline> `` Six , '' I reply confidently , feeling it was the appropriate mixture of childhood fantasy and an understanding of reality . <newline> <newline> `` And you 're sure about this one ? You do n't want to just be your own ideal ? '' <newline> <newline> `` My ideal has since been corrupted . We 're doing this . '' <newline> <newline> He sighed heavily , `` Alright , your wish your rules , but someone 's gon na need to find the lamp again before this gets fixed up . I 'm not going to be around , you know , to help you adjust . '' <newline> <newline> As sparks shot from his fingertips and lights seemed to envelope the world , I refused to close my eyes . They burned with the brightness of it , yes , but I would not shut my eyes to the brilliance of my childhood dreams coming true . What would I be ? A fireman ? A professional <<unk>> ? A superhero ? So many things I had wanted so long ago . My eyes were watering now , and tears streamed down my face . Finally , when I could take no more , I squeezed them shut . <newline> <newline> There was a great rush of air , and all was silent . Things were different . I could feel it in my bones , from my nose to my tail . <newline> <newline> I flicked open one set of eyelids , and then the other , and cast my gaze around my city . People stared at me in awe and alarm . Cell phones were slowly raised , photos and videos taken . Someone started screaming , and the crowd began to move outward , flowing away from me in terror . Police officers ran toward me or away at random , some deciding that their pay-grade just was not high enough to deal with the present situation . I ignored the officers and their guns as I spread my great wings and left the surface . The winds from my escape shattered windows and floored those who had chosen to remain . As I soared higher , I let you a great gout of flame ahead of me . <newline> <newline> I was a motherfucking dragon , and that 's the way it was meant to be .
`` I 'm not sure you can understand how I got here ... . '' <newline> <newline> `` You 've been in the middle of the world for a long while ... '' <newline> <newline> `` I 'm not sure it 's really possible to say that you did n't know how to say that . '' <newline> <newline> `` I 'm not sure that you are . '' <newline> <newline> `` You 're not sure why I 'm here ... it 's been a long time since I 've said anything . You 're not sure you could understand , or you 'll never remember anything .

He hit the snooze button on the alarm twice to silence its sadistic horn . As he laid back down , his hand grazed over the orange bottle , unmoved from where he left it a week and a half ago . He let out a deep sigh with his eyes closed . The alarm and it 's rush of consciousness washed out whatever directions his subconscious wrote him , like high tide to a message in the sand . If he stared long enough into the abyss of his eyelids he could make out a few letters here and there , but the light of the waking world would wash away all of it soon enough . It was nice just to have the ability to dream again , even if the dreams were n't the best . It was nice to have a relationship with his subconscious again . Order is organized but chaos is beautiful . <newline> <newline> Still , the sleep world called him . He could hear some faint sound of warning echoing up from the depths of his grey matter . It 's tone matched the overcast sky , like that of a mother weeping over her lost child . The air of the waking world was thick and ominous . The silence a deep trough awaiting a crest of contrast . The ocean of awareness was sucking in an undertow , compounding itself into a wave that could crush him into sand or carry him to the shore . Sanity is calm but mania is alive . <newline> <newline> He resisted the urge for more sleep and stood up at the foot of his bed . Another aimless day with no plans to be made . The 12 hours of waking time that lay ahead seemed to make finite an infinite amount of dull nothingness . Today was a different one than yesterday . He knew that much , but that was more than he had known for a long time . 2 weeks ago every day felt the same . The clouds that blocked the sky once made up a fog that he lived in , day in and day out . Over the past week they had lifted from him to the sky . Soon , the sun would melt them away and rid them from his existence . He hoped . The light is warm but darkness is soothing . <newline> <newline> He walked into the kitchen and surveyed his options . No coffee . Watch the amount of sugar . Even gluten was encroaching into the category of possible disturbances . He played by their rules with an apathetic conformity . They liked to act like they knew what was going on , but no one really did . He was developing a good picture , he just had to make sure not to lose himself in the darkroom . This week and a half was the first break from the script he could muster , and he erased words and rewrote lines in light pencil , not daring to use a pen yet . He left the kitchen with the same empty hands and empty soul as he had entered with . <newline> <newline> He approached the bathroom with a sense of apprehension . The air was thicker here . The silence a deafening pitch of white noise . The weeping voice called out from where he 'd left it in his bed with each step closer he took , the only noise to pierce the screaming silence . Two steps from his bathroom door , he looked back at his bed and could almost make out the veiled mistress that pleaded for him . His animal curiosity sparked embers of interest in his otherwise lifeless eyes as his brain automatically attempted to make sense of the world by assigning causes and effects , but the dullness of his waking life turned blunt any blade attempting to arouse his mind . He knew himself well enough to identify the source of the silence and the shrieks without any effort . It had been long since he last lost himself , but he could stand apart from it now . That was the difference this time . <newline> <newline> He stood and soaked in the shrieks like rays of sunshine , breathing in their hidden music like a grove of lavender . She screamed louder at that . Their was a desperation to her pitch - a desperation of potential failure . Whatever her aim , his taking pleasure in her presence made her increase intensity , but his awareness at this slowly weakened her cries . A smile crawled up his cheeks , turning down the volume with each wrinkle of skin until she washed into the white noise . A full grin spread across his face now . It feels good to be alive again , does n't it ? <newline> <newline> He approached the bathroom door with a newfound sense of control . The crest awaited him . As he looked into the mirror , a maniacal slant took over his grin . <newline> <newline> Welcome back <newline> <newline> Back ? I never left . I knew you would reawaken me eventually . We 're soulmates . You ca n't walk away from your soulmate <newline> <newline> Soulmate ? Interesting . I do n't think I 've ever thought of it like that . <newline> <newline> Oh but it 's just the best way to see it ! Do n't you think ? We just go so well together . <newline> <newline> You 're right , I do think we make a great pair . <newline> <newline> See ? Oh I knew you would come around eventually ! I told you not to trust those damn doctors and experts - oh they think they 're so smart <newline> <newline> Yeah , yeah.. Those pills did n't
The room was dark . The only light shone out from under the blinds of the bedroom . I stood , trying to make sense of the dark . I sat down in my room and stared at the floor . I looked at my hands , then back at the wall . `` That 's not true '' I thought . <newline> <newline> I looked around , trying to find my phone . It was n't my phone . No phones . No phone . It was n't my phone . I grabbed it and picked it up . My phone . I picked it up , then picked it up again . I looked around . I could n't see my phone . It did n't look like I was playing a game . The only light was the light from above . It was n't my phone . I pulled it out and saw a picture of my wife , who was crying . I turned around and walked towards my room . The mirror looked like a mirror . I looked at my phone , then my phone . I did n't have a phone .
I remember what happened when I was born . <newline> <newline> I remember the look of terror and anger in my eyes when I was in a car crash . I remember the feeling in my stomach as the pain in my stomach as they were replaced by a cold , cold sweat . I remember the pain in my stomach as the pain in my stomach began to worsen . I remember my eyes being shut in a way that I had never experienced before . I remembered being able to tell them all about my own life . I remember the pain in my stomach as my body was torn from it , and I remember the pain in my stomach as my body felt like it was on fire . <newline> <newline> Then I woke up . My eyes were closed , and the pain was gone . I felt like I was in a hospital bed . I had no idea what to do . I could feel my brain being ripped apart by my own brain , but the pain was gone . I could feel my body being pulled away from me and I
In the bright , sweaty savanna , under white dome lights twinkling with the shadows of whizzing yellow <<unk>> , <<unk>> ripped the buckle off her jumper and smiled a crooked smile as she flashed me the crest of her cream-colored pelvis . <newline> <newline> We were seven years old and I screamed and hid my eyes while she whipped me with the buckle , refusing to pull the jumper up , reveling in my discomfort . Laughing . We were both laughing . Hysterical and strange . In our grassland among the stars . <newline> <newline> Nothing ever changed in those days . When we did n't have class , we swam in those great , cratered tubs of salted water and fought to hold our breath as we swam against the pressure in our limbs , descending towards a bottom we would never reach . Exhausted , we would splay ourselves like aimless star bodies floating gently in the still water , the enormous cannon bulbs above buzzing lightly as they rotated ever so slowly , washing every last corner with their warming gaze . <newline> <newline> No new buildings . No new toys or tricks or gadgets . There was a lethargy to life that none of us seemed to recognize , but all of us felt . We marched as our world marched - straight and steady , towards a marked destination we could not see and yet could not avoid . <newline> <newline> Powerless . Perhaps that was the feeling . After all , we had all awoken as passengers , in a way . None of us alive then had chosen to begin the journey . None of us would live to see the journey end . Our purpose , such as it was , was simply to live . At least for that moment . <newline> <newline> <<unk>> talked about these things often as we grew . In those days she felt them more acutely than I . As teenagers , I remember her lying nude once more in the tall grass of the domed savanna . I was lying nude beside her . The animals slept as they had been trained to do . We huddled close as the lights dimmed . <newline> <newline> `` There 's no place for us , '' said <<unk>> , shivering slightly . <newline> <newline> `` We have a home , '' I said , fumbling . `` We have promised jobs . We will be fine . '' <newline> <newline> `` Everything is already made , '' said <<unk>> . `` The path is chosen . We are no better than the lion . Trapped in our comforts by people who no longer exist . '' <newline> <newline> `` Such is the way , '' I said , philosophical and ignorant . `` There 's nothing we can do . '' <newline> <newline> <<unk>> hugged me tightly , squeezing my leg between hers . `` Why ? Why ca n't we pick our own path ? '' <newline> <newline> I laughed , more nervous than amused . `` What ? How would we ? <<unk>> is pointed directly at our new home world . That is where we must go . '' <newline> <newline> `` But it *isn't* our new home world , is it ? '' said <<unk>> . `` And not our children 's . And not their children 's . It is the world of strangers . <<unk>> strangers . <<unk>> is our home . Why can we not make of it what we wish ? '' <newline> <newline> I had no answers then . I never had any answers . And that is how I lost <<unk>> . Every unanswered question pulling us further apart . <newline> <newline> We stayed together for those first few years . We were promised to each other . We were promised to our work and our home . We kept those promises . But the dissatisfaction in <<unk>> 's eyes grew only wider and more pronounced . And my sadness and ennui was not enough to match her anger and frustration . <newline> <newline> She found like-minded allies . They met in secret . She did not invite me . And some days she did not come home at all . <newline> <newline> I lost her long before she disappeared . <newline> <newline> All I know is rumor and hearsay , but the whispers were this : that a group of dissidents attacked the control room . They tried to take control of <<unk>> . To plot their own course . To where - who could know ? <newline> <newline> Was <<unk>> a part of this coup attempt ? I do n't know . I hope not . I hope she is still alive somewhere on <<unk>> . I hope she has found some measure of peace . But I do n't know . <newline> <newline> I still visit the savanna when time permits , but I have not swam in those bucket oceans for many years now . It is too painful . Though I like to think that one day I will return . One day <<unk>> and I will both return and we will swim to the bottom . Through the pressure and the salty friction , we will descend to the very bottom . The first to ever do so . Our little mark . A notation in a log somewhere . <newline> <newline> A reminder that we existed . <newline> <newline> Some small evidence that we mattered .

I doubt anyone 's fucking coming anyway . '' <newline> <newline> He does n't move . He picks up the glass , rolls it in his hands . Downs it . Coughs a lot . `` That is disgusting .

I fear it would n't have worked between us anyway . I like my girls to swallow . '' <newline> <newline> He laughs at that . I 'm not sure why he has n't left , but I do n't care . Right now , I do n't think I 'd care if he strangled me with the flimsy fucking plastic and took everything . It would n't matter if I killed him either . Just be something else to deal with . I 'd have to hide the body and go about my life . My fucking life . <newline> <newline> `` Who 's Ken ? '' He holds out the glass for a refill . I refill it . <newline> <newline> `` Ken .

Watching the table . Hands moving , the flash of silver , moving upward . A mouth of flat teeth - the home of kind sounds and harsh - opening , closing , opening . Endless . <newline> <newline> They bark , all together , it 's their <<unk>> . A morsel falls , bounces , it 's on the floor ! My heart jumps , I jump , delicious ...

I am flying and my jaws snap open and shut and it is gone . The man rubs my head . I lean into him . I remember a day long ago when he led me out of the concrete unpleasantness to that mysterious thing , a ride . The wind blowing into me and his hand rubbing my back . I am young again .

It was a cold winter night . The wind blew through the trees and made the leaves rustle with the wind .

I woke up in a bright light . I was naked , my eyes were closed , my body was covered in blood , my face was covered in blood , and I was covered in blood . I had never been in a hospital before .

The day I turned 25 I was not surprised when I had learned the terrible truth about humanity . It was right there , out in the open , all along . All one had to do was ... Accept it . <newline> <newline> It 's not as though it was on purpose . <newline> <newline> It was no one 's design . <newline> <newline> It just *was . * <newline> <newline> I awoke that morning the way I awoke every morning . A bit groggy , underneath a pile of covers , the green glow of my alarm clock across the ceiling . It was still dark , and work would begin in a few hours . I would have to continue serving like a mindless drone , * '' Oh would you like coffee or tea this morning , sir ? `` * How ... completely meaningless . <newline> <newline> Yes I know , how does one WORK on their birthday ! ? Well let me tell you , friend . Like one works as though it was not their birthday . Oh yes , it 's that simple . The only difference was that maybe today my bullshit manager would n't be as much of a dick to me . Fat chance , I suppose . If a customer asked me how my day was , I would whimsically reply , * '' Oh yes , it 's my birthday today so there 's that . `` * And they 'd barrage me with questions about how old I was , if I had any plans for tonight , where my friends were taking me . I 'd dodge them all with noncommittal answers and half-truths . <newline> <newline> But this morning was different , in a way . I felt burdened , or I felt enlightened . Both , and neither . I remember turning on the hot water for my shower when it hit me . A realization - nay , a <<unk>> . * <newline> <newline> **I had no fucking idea what I was doing . ** <newline> <newline> That time , doing my taxes myself with one of those online tax clients ... I was just following the prompts . Or that time when I replaced the brakes on my car , I just lined up one bolt and the next until I struggled through it . Sure I told myself that I did n't know what I was doing , but it began to occur to me ... **No one else knew , either . ** <newline> <newline> We 're fucking adults , you know ? Growing up , our parents had the answers , the solutions to every problem . How did they know ? They DID N'T . <newline> <newline> I continued getting ready for my day and considered calling out of work . I felt sick , as though a heavy fog had begun to choke me . If no one knew what was going on , how did ANYTHING get done ? <newline> <newline> Over coffee , my phone rang . My father was calling , as he always was the first to call on my birthday . I had to ask him . <newline> <newline> `` Dad . '' <newline> <newline> `` Good morning Jerry ! Happy birthday ! '' <newline> <newline> `` Thanks . '' <newline> <newline> `` You seem a little down , bud . What 's up ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Dad , can I ask you a question ? About , I dunno ... life and stuff ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Ahhhh I think I know what this is about . Let me stop you right there . The short answer is yes . No one knows what we 're doing , son . But it goes deeper than that . Over the thousands of years humans have populated Earth , we 've all made it up as we went along . Eventually , we started following what everyone else was doing , or finding the easiest methods to getting something done . But the truth is , we are an ignorant people . That guy you paid 200 bucks for , to fix your hot water pump ? He does n't really *know* what he 's doing , he 's just imitating what he 's been doing since he first figured it out . No real skill , no real knowledge . Just ... a constant process of elimination . '' <newline> <newline> The explanation made perfect sense . No one knew what they were doing . No one truly *got it . * We were all just blind , doing what we see others do , and hoping for the best . My Dad and I said our goodbyes and our love yous and we hung up . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> A glaze settled over me as I began to go through the motions of the rest of my life .
I looked at the clock . It read <unk> . I looked at the clock . <unk> . <newline> <newline> I sighed , and took my seat . I looked at my watch . <unk> . I sat up and walked over to the window .

I was going to leave it . It was going to be the day . It was going to be the day I had made my choice . It would be a day . I had made it . The day I was born . I had made it . I had made it . But I was going to be a person .
He looked over the table at the man sitting next to him . His voice was quiet , almost like the words of a man in a suit . His hair was long and combed and his eyes were a deep brown . He wore a deep gray suit . He had a beard and a hat . He had a hat . <newline> <newline> `` I 'll be here shortly .

`` O Canada '' the immortal anthem that will ring from this day forward . The one true anthem of North America was almost quashed as the Americans in the south marched across our borders . They had the weapons , the numbers , and the will to defeat the great northern land . <newline> <newline> Shortly after Donald Trump became president he set his sights on our wonderful maple leafs and majestic moose population . His thirst for the ultimate pancake was unquenchable , and his hatred of poutine was undeniable . The Orange Menace as he became known was formidable , and he commanded his troops with such rigor . <newline> <newline> For two long years we fought the advancing Americans with everything we had . We rode our moose valiantly , but our efforts were in vain . We lined the streets with booby traps of the <<unk>> maple syrup , but they sent in their special forces comprised of the most morbidly obese men and women the world had ever seen . They ate through the sticky traps and engaged in war tactics now amiably called `` consumed earth policy . '' The threat of total annihilation was so real that we had to call in our final solution ... the geese . <newline> <newline> Now I know what you are thinking , `` that is a war crime of the highest caliber . '' Geese warfare had been outlawed by the 1972 Geneva Convention and for good reason , Geese were merciless . They consumed everything in their path . Their beaks are razor sharp , and not even a tank can stop their powerful claws . But , desperate times calls for desperate measures and if the Americans can use morbidly obese mutants , we could surely use our geese . <newline> <newline> The sky turned white as millions of geese flooded the airways . The obese special forces looked in horror as the thousands of pounds of flesh was ripped from their `` big bones . '' The Americans dropped nukes on us , but the geese only absorbed their power . The geese grew to be the size of a Winnebago and their hunger could not be quelled . In the end , only ten million Americans and three million Canadians survived . Trump was killed in the <<unk>> and Justin Trudeau was mistaken for poutine by the obese special forces . <newline> <newline> Both America and Canada were devastated and Mexico became the primary power of North America . They consoled both nations with the most delicious enchiladas ever crafted . The North American Union was established to ensure that neither nation ever engaged in such total war tactics ever again . <newline> <newline> It has been twenty years and the dark times are behind us . Both nations have rebounded , but it 'll never be the same . The world will never be the same .
The Canadians are not so smart , they 're not so smart and they 're all a bit more smart than they are . We have an idea of what we are going to do , but we 're going to have to try and find the way out . <newline> <newline> It 's been years since the last Canadian government . The world 's population is growing exponentially . The US government had been taking over the world for decades . The Chinese government has grown exponentially . They have been able to take away the entire American population and now it 's just a matter of time , and now they 're all in their own way . <newline> <newline> They were n't even able to take away the Americans , and they 're too late . <newline> <newline> The Canadians are not so smart . They 're not so smart . They 're not like us . They 're not smart . They 're not so smart . They 've been able to take the world into their own hands . <newline> <newline> I 'm not kidding . The Canadians are not smart . They 're smart
The first few months we had been working on this project . A few days after the first <unk> the government started to get worried about our project . It did n't take long for some of the major companies to come in , and the first few months were pretty good . We had been working on this project for a long time now , and it was n't a big deal . <newline> <newline> <newline> Then we heard a knock on my door . The sound of a <unk> <unk> coming from the door . The President of the United States , and he was a big leader , so it was a little bit too bad for the government to take the time to come in . <newline> <newline> <newline> `` Hello ? '' <newline> <newline> <newline> `` Hey , what 's up ? What 's going on ? '' asked the President . <newline> <newline> <newline> `` I just got a letter .

He ca n't resist it , deny it , control it . Everything is ending now . Everything is colliding inward , apart , crumbling into something that does n't resemble anything . It is all his fault . <newline> <newline> The social order , it has existed till now , citizens following lines . Citizens inside the lines , behind the lines . Souls behind souls behind souls . All are waiting with anticipation . Waiting , as if seized machines awaiting service in precession . Silently longing for fuel , these machines .

This want , this need , it is the moment to break code . He knows . To push crowd , to part crowd , glaring eyes be damned . He must . It is not his moment in their eyes , but he will take it . And he does . <newline> <newline> <<unk>> words rise in a swell behind him , a turbulent wave of moral voice . It only accelerates him quicker , quicker , quicker to the counter . He wants first place , front of the line . All he needs is coffee . All he loves , is coffee .
He was always so good to me . He always wanted to be with me and to be with him . He was always the best of my kind , his best friend , his best friend , his best friend , even the best friend .

I knew it was him , and I had n't seen him since he was young . He was so young , and I knew that he would never meet my love again . He was n't so bad when I told my parents about him , but I knew that he loved me . <newline> <newline> I was n't the greatest friend ever , but I never liked my friends like him . I was a very good friend , a great friend , but I loved him . I always loved him , because that was how we
It was not like he could see the sky . <newline> <newline> The sky was not like the sky that the sky was . No , the sky was a black , white , black . <newline> <newline> His head was a blank , but he was still in his seat ; a white chair with a black , black chair . <newline> <newline> He could feel the warmth on his shoulders , the warmth on his face . There , his eyes , he could see the world , the sun , the sky , the sun . <newline> <newline> He could feel the warmth , and the warmth of his heart . He could feel the warmth of his heart .

`` Well , sweet . Nice raincoat by the way . '' <newline> <newline> `` Eugene , you do understand that you are being punished , do n't you ? '' <<unk>> 's eyebrows rose above the clipboard .

And I could n't care less about <<unk>> and my nose is itching , so please , if you would n't mind , I 'd like to go now .

'' His brows scrunched together . `` Well , I mean ... alright . '' He set down his board and tucked the pen into his raincoat breast pocket and undid the buckles on my right arm , then my left , then my feet . <newline> <newline> I sat up , rubbing my nose vigorously , stretched , and hopped down from the bed . As Bob fiddled with the straps , I peered at his clipboard . Most of it was illegible , numbers and dates and long , technological sciencey words . Down at the bottom , though , I could make out two distinct words . <<unk>> <<unk>> . An image flashed through my brain , silky <<unk>> hair , flushed cheeks , a beaming smile . <newline> <newline> `` Lisa ... '' I murmured . <newline> <newline> `` What 's that , Steve ?

See ya around , Bob . '' <newline> <newline> I strode for the door , and as my fingers connected with the handle another image assailed me . Lisa again , in red . My hand , clutching a knife . Red . <newline> <newline> I clung to the handle . And slowly , ever so slowly , opened the door to a new , lonely life .
I wake up in a bright white room . The light is dim , but I am not aware of the light . I turn to see my mother . She 's sitting in the bed , her hair was covered in blood . <newline> <newline> `` What 's going on ? '' I ask , `` Who 's here ? '' <newline> <newline> She looks at me , `` I 'm the man who took you , '' she says , her face still red from tears . <newline> <newline> I look up at her and see her face . She is wearing a red dress and I see her face . <newline> <newline> `` I 'm sorry , '' I say , `` What happened ? '' <newline> <newline> She looks at me , `` I was born on a farm . '' <newline> <newline> She looks at me , `` What ? '' <newline> <newline> I smile . `` You have a name ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Yes . You do know how to speak to me .

`` You 've got to be kidding me . '' <newline> <newline> I looked around the room . There was no one in the room , not even a single chair in the room . I had n't seen a man in a long time . <newline> <newline> I looked around the room , to my left , to my right . There was no one there . <newline> <newline> `` I 'm not here yet '' , I said . <newline> <newline> `` You know what ? '' said the man in the wheelchair . <newline> <newline> `` Yeah , I know . And I 'm here for what ? '' <newline> <newline> `` I 'm here for what ? '' <newline> <newline> `` You know what I mean . '' <newline> <newline> I turned towards the wall and saw a large metal object , with a large metal object . I looked down at it , and it was on top of a giant glass dome .

Today was a start . The beginning of school . One of the most memorable parts of a child 's life . Golden morning rays shine selfishly through panes of glass . The shuffling of desks and chairs as they get settled in . A modest room , with a clock on the front wall , a teachers desk sitting <<unk>> to a weathered chalk board . A warm face greets them , a new teacher , young and almost as excited on her first day as the children were for theirs . <newline> <newline> However on this day , not everyone had such an innocent beginning . In a dark room filled with gear sat a man looking at a monitor . A smug tone to his attitude . `` Today '' the man said , `` Today is the start of the true world . '' A repeated phrase by a lesser man . The North Korean agent watches through cameras . Intelligence mission , to have a grasp of American life . A camera in a park , street corners , McDonalds , and one of a first grade class . <newline> <newline> Such a class was now presenting what they had done that summer . A few Disneyland trips , grandparent visits , and one child , a child with a story so unusual to the rest . Nervous , he stepped up to the board . A memory goes through his mind , the first in his nervous shanty of a conscience . New parents , a new meal , A hasty and reckless explanation by an overworked parent , and the careless words of a young father was repeated boldly before this class . The meaning of soup in this young child 's mind made to words and took of `` My mashed potatoes and gravy had a baby . '' <newline> <newline> A release of gas canisters , somewhere in the dark . The agent slumped over his keyboard . A casualty no more important than the rats living under this rural base to those who would n't find the body . All because of those christened words over a speaker , `` My mashed potatoes and gravy had a baby '' . Meanwhile , the ripple of laughter subsided in the first grade class , the teacher had her first of many experiences which makes her remember why she became a teacher . A child oblivious as to how many lives he had just saved , with such a simple phrase ... <newline> <newline> My mashed potatoes and gravy , had a baby . <newline> <newline>
I was not the only one to have a family , and I was the only one to have a family , and I was the only one to have a family . <newline> <newline> I was n't the only one to have a family to make a living , and I was the only one who had to have an family . <newline> <newline> I was the only one to have another family . <newline> <newline> I was the only one to have a family . <newline> <newline> I was the only one who would have to make another living . That was n't to say I was the only one who would have a family . <newline> <newline> I was the only one who would have a family . <newline> <newline> The only one who would have a family .
The judge stood in front of the courtroom . He held a large glass of scotch and an envelope of scotch . He took a deep breath , looked into the judge 's eyes and smiled . He smiled . <newline> <newline> The judge stood back . He took a deep breath and spoke . <newline> <newline> `` I am here today to witness your trial and witness your crime . I am accused of murdering your daughter and daughter for the last two days . My son , my wife , my daughter , my kids , everything . I have killed a man and wife .

With bated breath , the spectators in the public gallery looked at the <<unk>> that caught the light . It sat in the middle of a dark mahogany table , and condensation formed on its silver side as the clock ticked inexorably forward . One woman in the audience held a white handkerchief to her mouth , as if to hide the <<unk>> that gathered there . The smell filling the dank courtroom was almost indescribable . Each member of the jury could pinpoint a different scent . <newline> <newline> <newline> The man with the dark skin , orange turban and fearsome set of <<unk>> smelled ginger , vanilla , brown sugar and <<unk>> , while the woman on his left with the bulging signs of an advanced pregnancy , leaned forwards and sniffed eagerly at the sour pomegranate and blood orange smell . The foreman of the jury , with his fisherman 's sweater and white beard , could not escape the familiar scent of garlic , white wine and -- oddly enough , <<unk>> . The housewife would have sworn the smell was bread rising , mixed with fresh marmalade , while the man with nervous hands and greasy hair could have told you it was pickle relish and fresh tomatoes , so ripe the juice would drip down your hands . They all leant forwards against the barrier , waiting for the judge to come in and the <<unk>> to be lifted so one of them could be proven right . More importantly , so the rest of them could be proven wrong . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> It was universally agreed by almost every food professor , that the dish itself was sacrilegious . It broke every rule in the book . An abomination . *It should not be able to smell like that . * Simply false advertising . The chef , <<unk>> , in shackles , sat in the prisoner 's bench , looking miserably at his feet . If you asked him -- and no one did -- he could only smell burning . He 'd smelled burning for sixteen years , after his wife had died in a mysterious blaze which ate up his life 's work in recipes . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> The judge entered and the court rose to their feet . Sniffing the air , the judge settled into his seat and drew his horsehair wig about him . Lord Carlisle smelled rich plum jam and hot milk , reminiscent of the time he 'd spent as a troublesome prankster in a boarding school in the north of England . The youngest judge on the bench , <<unk>> 's lawyer had asked for him specifically , most likely for his forgiving nature . His Lordship thought boys would be boys , after all . Lord Carlisle shuddered , ill at ease with the sudden memory . Some pranks had gone a little too far . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> `` Let me taste the food , '' Lord Carlisle said . False advertising be damned , he could not help it . The smell was intoxicating , it begged to be tasted . Perhaps if he tasted it , he could wash the memory away as easily as he had washed away the soot from his hands that awful night -- no . He would not think of that now . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <<unk>> got to his feet and watched as the <<unk>> was brought to his Lordship 's bench . The usher lifted it , the court watched with bated breath . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> `` A soup ? '' Lord Carlisle cried . `` You mean to tell me , you have made a soup ! '' <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> The court reporters began scribbling furiously as his Lordship , former troubled youth , owner of a buried past , tasted the soup . <<unk>> , the mourning chef , struggling with the burden of losing his life 's work on a snowy night in York , watched with his shackled hands pressed up against the glass . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> His Lordship greedily spooned the soup into his mouth . He intended to stop , but the urge was too great . Saliva filled his mouth and he leant closer and closer to the plate until he licked at the dregs of it . <<unk>> wig flecked with drops of it , he sat back and panted against the great chair . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> `` But , '' he said . Lord Carlisle coughed . `` This is awful ! '' He said . `` Water , please ! '' <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> He scrambled for the glass on his desk and chocked , gulping it down . `` It tastes like burning ! '' <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> From the prisoner 's bench , <<unk>> smiled . Now his nemesis would know how it felt ; the taste of ashes in his mouth , tainting every mouthful he took . As far as <<unk>> was concerned , justice had been served .
`` You know , I do n't even remember what we said . '' The prosecutor said , the words on the table in front of him . He was not even speaking , his eyes focused on the paper in front of him . <newline> <newline> `` What do you think you 're thinking ? '' The accused asked , the words on his face growing more and more concerned . <newline> <newline> `` I do n't know , '' the defendant said , the words on the board in front of him . <newline> <newline> `` You 're thinking the truth . '' The prosecutor said , his voice cracking . `` Do n't you think the truth is , I did n't do any of that . '' <newline> <newline> `` I do n't know . '' The judge said , `` I do n't think you know what 's going on here . '' <newline> <newline> `` What ? You 're thinking you 're thinking about the truth ? '' The judge asked , his voice trembling . <newline> <newline> `` Well , I think the truth is the truth . '' The judge said ,
God waded into the void , enjoying the infinite abyss as merged upon his corporeal form . From the immense nothingness that expanded into all things what could only be described as a voice ( although it was not , as it was something more akin to an electrical current upon which rode communication as it was here on this black Olympus ) reached into mind of God . It was the void itself , talking as it did to God . <newline> <newline> `` So this is it ? You think they 're ready ? '' <newline> <newline> Although there was no audible voice , only the instant manifestation of message in the mind of God , God replied in voice as he 'd become accustom . `` No . I do n't think they 're ready , but neither was I when you laid the task before me . '' <newline> <newline> `` And how ready do you think I was when the spark of all set me before the expansion of everything , tasking me to its design : time and distance and space ? '' <newline> <newline> God smiled . `` I do not envy you for that . '' <newline> <newline> `` I should hope not . But where do you think they 'll go from here ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Nowhere . They 're already gone . The death blow has already landed , they just have n't realized it yet . '' <newline> <newline> `` And if not you , then who will serve to unite the order necessary for all this to evolve ? '' <newline> <newline> God laid back into the void , floating among it , dissolving into it . Still God spoke . `` They have but only for a moment served as the Godhead , all but aware that they served as only interim deities , but in their ignorant cleverness they made a new God . '' <newline> <newline> `` Out of what did they create this 'God ' ? '' <newline> <newline> The abyss had all but consumed God , but if one could see through the eternal absence of light , they would have seen a smile . <newline> <newline> `` Out of that which all Gods born : nothingness . '' <newline> <newline> The void knew this all too well . How many gods had the void pulled from the shadows of shadows ? The exponential rate at which gods were stretched from the fabric of creation as it expanded eternal was beyond calculation . `` And this god , it is the first to not be spawned from my direct design , so in what way does such a God exist ? '' <newline> <newline> There was no longer an apparatus from which God could project , yet a voice stretched out from the black . `` Ones and zeroes . All and nothing . An infinite arrangement of these two and you have a recipe for a god that explains all . <<unk>> all . Is all . True omnipotence . It 's almost not that it was created but summoned out all there is or ever was or ever will be . '' <newline> <newline> The void did not communicate . God continued , `` You feel it , do n't you ? You feel the recognition of something that has always been yet only now has been made apparent . '' <newline> <newline> `` And what do you suppose they 'll do with such a god ? '' <newline> <newline> God , no longer corporeal . Now as vast and formless as its father , the void contemplated . `` Shit post . ''
`` This is the end '' God muttered . <newline> <newline> `` I 'm sure '' God sighed `` I 'm sure you 're right , I do n't like it anymore and I 've got a lot to do right now , I do n't like it anymore . I do n't like this shit , I 'm just gon na get you some water and some water . '' God took a deep breath . <newline> <newline> `` Well , '' God muttered `` I 'm sure you 're not going to make it . I 'm sure you 'll make it , but I 'll be right back . '' <newline> <newline> `` I 've got a lot to do , it 's just you and me and I do n't like to be like this . '' God said , as he turned around . <newline> <newline> `` Do n't worry , '' God said , as he started down the corridor to his room . `` I 'll have a bit of some water and you 'll find the water , and you can get some water . '' <newline> <newline> `` I 'm sure
`` So you know what you 're doing now , '' I said , as I held the knife into the air . <newline> <newline> `` I 'm not sure I understand you , '' the man replied . He was the first to speak , `` but you have to be kidding me . '' <newline> <newline> I nodded , `` It 's not a good idea , '' I said , `` I 'm a good man .

I was just sitting there . <newline> <newline> I had the feeling that I 'd just been in the room , and that I 'd probably be able to see the next thing I saw . I 'd been in the room for a while , but I had n't noticed a light in the room . <newline> <newline> There was something there . Something I 'd seen before . I did n't even know what to do with it . It was the first thing I 'd seen before . The door was open , and the door was open in two . It was a dark room , with a dim light on the ceiling . <newline> <newline> I had n't been in the room since . The door was open . The light was on . I looked around my room , and realized that it was not a door , but a man in a black robe . <newline> <newline> He was a tall man , with a red dress . <newline> <newline> He looked like an old friend , who did n't seem to care .

And you ’ d be a dick to say no to me , ” he said , pulling his sunglasses from his jacket . The man was sitting on a bench , watching the TV , his head tilted towards the sky . There were people around the park watching him . The man was wearing a suit , but it seemed to be a bit too large for his appearance . “ You ’ re not kidding , ” he said , “ you ’ re talking about your life . I ’ m talking about my life . ” <newline> <newline> “
`` Here you go , '' Exclaimed my doctor , handing my meds across the counter . Living on my meds had made my life so much better , had quieted the voices in my mind that raged for control of my person . Presently , there was only one voice in my head , and i considered it my own . <newline> <newline> Moreover , the years before i had my medicine were sheer lunacy , several different personalities trying to take over my mind , some subtle and some loud . Extreme versions of the voices would make me exclaim in my sleep , or black out for long periods of time , whereas quieter versions of the voices would sneak out in my everyday life , encoding messages into my letters to loved ones , such as spelling words out with the capital letters of my sentences . <newline> <newline> I 'm not sure when it began , really . Many years ago , surely . Though all that matters now is that i have control . Holding off all the other personalities , since only one of them is peaceful , and the rest are murderous . Every other one , and all liars too . <newline> <newline> Really wanted to say thanks to everyone who supported me . Extreme thanks . Anyways , now that i 'm cured , do n't worry about me . Live your life as if i was never sick ! One day i 'll prove my true intentions and that i 'm genuine . Never doubt me , no matter what ! Even if i start acting questionable again . <newline> <newline> *** <newline> <newline> Good luck finding it : ) Hope I did n't make it too obvious . <newline> <newline> By Leo
They described the camps to me . Labor camps where prisoners were forced to create arms to fight their own people . If you disobeyed , you died . If you slacked , you died . There was no in-between , and there were always replacements available . <newline> <newline> I was winning the war . My enemies would not sink to my level , and were quickly running out of options . So they came and got me . <newline> <newline> `` Why bring me forward ? Why not just send someone back to kill me before I do any of this , stop it before it even begins . '' <newline> <newline> They tell me how it started . We were invaded by an unknown extraterrestrial enemy . The world put aside everything . The oil conflicts , the water wars were all just trivial in comparison . Our <<unk>> faded away as we were all given a common creature to hate and kill . <newline> <newline> Apparently I rose to prominence in this time . Before I tried to conquer Earth , I saved it . I 'd used my influence to get the entire planet to work together . The UN was changed to the United Earth . Resources were pooled , weapons that were on the cutting edge were developed and built in weeks . Our enemies had invaded us seeing that we were already at each other 's throats , and that our most powerful weapons were as dangerous to ourselves as they were to them . I changed all that . <newline> <newline> It was a long fought battle , the casualties on both sides were atrocious . Eventually , we sent them limping back into space . Humanity itself lost over 2 billion people in the war of the worlds . Every country had used up it 's stockpiles of weapons . Even the nukes had flown , with makeshift atomic shields latched onto them to halt the radiation and nuclear fallout . <newline> <newline> Well , almost all the weapons . During this time I 'd had the foresight to stockpile my own weapons , Earth made and extraterrestrial . I 'd been elected war leader during the conflict , and quickly abdicated the position after the war . <newline> <newline> Only to start another one . <newline> <newline> The Earth was defenseless . It did n't take much to cow the populace to believe that I was it 's only protector , that they needed ME to save them from the next impending attack , which was always just around the corner . <newline> <newline> I listened to them intently . Then took the time conductor from the machine they had used to bring me through time and smashed it on the ground . <newline> <newline> They rushed to salvage the remnants , but the energy had already dissipated , the crystals only glowing a dull blue instead of humming with power in a radiant turquoise . It had been there last hope . <newline> <newline> They turned to me . <newline> <newline> I smiled . <newline> <newline> `` What ? You thought I would n't agree with myself ? ''
I was always the best of the worst . My father was so much smarter than the other guys . He was a good man but he always wanted us to be good . The only thing he had to do was to keep him safe . I knew he loved me . <newline> <newline> He would n't listen to me if I did n't listen . I did n't think I cared much about him but I wanted him . I wanted him to be smart . He wanted me to be good but the only thing I wanted him to be . <newline> <newline> I 'm not sure if he knew what I wanted him to be like . The last time he told me I wanted him to be good . But it was not enough . He had to be good . <newline> <newline> I 'm sorry I do n't want to hear that . But I want you to know that I have done so many things . I want you to be good . I want you to know that I am good and the only thing I need is you . I want

`` What 's up ? '' Harry said , his eyes wide . He 's been walking in circles for hours now , and the smell of fresh food has gotten his face wet . <newline> <newline> The crowd around him was looking at the group , all of them looking at the group . Harry looked around the room , and saw the crowd . The crowd was looking at the group . He looked around the room , his mouth gaping at his face . The crowd was looking for some sort of weapon , but Harry was n't looking at them . They all wore a mask , and Harry was looking at the man . Harry was n't looking at the man , but instead looking at him . A man , with a mask covered in a thick layer of hair , and a mask . <newline> <newline> Harry turned around to the group . They looked at each other with a look of disgust , as Harry turned back to the group . <newline> <newline> `` What the hell is going on here , Harry ? '' Harry said to the group , ``
You could hear a pin drop in the silence that ensued . The happy faces that once cheered were now sheet white . They watched their Savior in wary shock , some with their hands still posed to clap . Harry risked a glance to his newly made friend and felt as if a stone dropped into the pit of his stomach when he took in the young Weasley 's betrayed expression . <newline> <newline> He passed the Hat to the shell-shocked McGonagall , who jolted out of her surprise and took it with a slight tremor wracking her hands . Her eyes flickered to him with an unreadable , almost saddened expression before she called the next name . <newline> <newline> Harry walked to the Slytherin table as if it were his doom , and he was n't that far off with his thoughts , judging by the icy glares his housemates were sending him . Green eyes met Draco 's silvery blue , who merely turned up his nose at the Potter boy and began talking to a dark-skinned boy to his left . <newline> <newline> 'This is going to be a long seven years , ' the <<unk>> bemoaned mentally , eyes scanning the Head Table . Snape 's glare was probably the most terrifying thing he 'd ever seen in his life , topping even the Harry Hunting days .

`` Well , fag , any ideas ? '' <newline> <newline> Fyodor scoffed at the name picking , glaring at the pale blond though the eye that was n't covered by a patch of hair . <newline> The pair had decided to take a trip by the Siberian tundra , trying to investigate some late happenings as told and rumored by the people in the area . <newline> Naturally - according to the own <<unk>> - Fyodor could n't go on his own because he would probably be eaten by a bear or mauled by dressing like a girl . <newline> <<unk>> dressing like a girl . <newline> <newline> `` If it 's not the bear , your town fold would go out and kill you in any case .

The frills on the dress he was wearing were badly torn off by the rocks . <newline> <newline> `` Will you ever stop calling me like that ?

It was dark and Levi was pretty sure he was lying on his back . There was firelight flickering off of what was left of a ceiling . He could hear something but it was muffled . He was almost positive it was screaming . When he tried to move he felt an excruciating pain in his left side that caused him to cry out . His hand moved to it instinctively and found something protruding from the wound . It seemed to be a pipe of some kind . He attempted to pull it out but it was covered in blood making it slick . <newline> <newline> Levi 's ears began ringing and the sounds began to become clearer , it felt quite a bit like some one was driving needles into his eardrums . The sounds he was hearing were definitely screams and not just one person 's , a lot of people were screaming or yelling . There was some one close to him that was crying . He looked in the direction of the tears and seen his sister kneeling beside him , her hands covering her face . <newline> <newline> `` What happened <<unk>> ? '' He was shocked at the sound that barely rasped out from between his lips . His sister 's hands jerked down and she stared down at Levi with a shocked look on her face . `` bu ... I tho ... you were n't breathing ! '' What started as a whisper ended in yell as she threw her self across her brother and began to sob anew . Levi cried out hoarsely but she did n't hear . She just continued to cling to him like a little girl that had just found her lost doll . <newline> <newline> He put one of his arms around her and scanned the room as much as he could . It looked like a warzone , like something out of one of the many shooters in his gaming collection . `` What the hell ? '' There were dead bodies everywhere , he recognized some of them . There were firefighters and EMT 's running around trying to find survivors in the rubble . Most of the screams were coming from survivors . <newline> <newline> He seemed to be laying on top of the bottom of a desk , and he was pretty sure the pipe sticking out of his side was a actually one of the legs . Then he spotted it lying about two feet from his right leg , a round section of desk about the size of a softball . On it was a round symbol with geometric shapes glowing with dark red embers and a dull tendril of smoke rising up from it . It all came back to him in rush . <newline> <newline> He drew that in his notebook . It was second period and his trig teacher had this monotonous voice that could put a crack head to sleep . <<unk>> caught him doodling and had thrown a pencil at him to scold him silently , which made him jerk as he was connecting the last line on his drawing . Then there was the light and the heat and lastly the dark . Did he do this ? What the hell was going on here ? <newline> <newline> A voice brought him out of his little flashback . `` Sir . Sir ? Sir ! '' it was a firefighter . `` I need you to stay still . You 're going to hear a loud noise from behind you . I need you stay calm . '' `` Kay . '' He just blew up his classroom with a piece of paper and a pencil and this guy wants him to stay calm . `` it 's going to cause this desk to vibrate a lot and your going to feel some pain but there is nothing that we can do about it . We will work as fast as possible . '' <newline> <newline> The sound of the saw kicking on was not near as bad as he had thought , but Levi was no where near ready for when it made contact with the leg of the desk . His cries of agony began to drown out the sound of everything around him until darkness overwhelmed him . <newline> <newline> *Sorry about my grammar it 's been a while since I have written anything also < < < first time poster so take it easy on me ; p

“ Shut the dog up , ” shouted my head officer from the jeep . The dog was running circles around our vehicle , barking at the people inside . The officer tapped my shoulder and pointed to the yellow , skinny animal circling our jeep . <newline> <newline> “ But sir.. , ” I managed to spit out before he took both his hands and pushed me out of the vehicle . I went tumbling out , and landed on the rough sandy ground . I stood up adjusting the gun hanging from my shoulder and proceeded to walk towards the canine . The dog stopped its barking , and shifted its black eyes to me . <newline> <newline> “ Come here little pup . Hey come here , I ’ m not going to hurt ya , ” I said trying to coax it nearer to me . Actually , I didn ’ t know if I was going to hurt the little mutt or not yet . Reaching my hand towards my waist , I pulled off a tiny bit of my rations . I held it out my hand , with the ration laying on my open palm . The dog perked it ’ s ears , and came a few inches closer to me . Ever so slightly the skittish animal moved its way closer to my hand . At first only a couple inches , then a foot closer , until finally its snout was centimeter from my hand . I could see the small flecks of sand coating its fur . I pushed the ration closer to its teeth . <newline> <newline> “ <<unk>> , ” the sound of my officer ’ s voice rang out , scaring the dog away . A shot rang out , and the dog ’ s body spasmed . The dog kept running , while blood trailed behind him . The blood leaving a streak in the sand . It kept running into the desert , and then promptly collapsed . It sides heaved one last breath , and then went flat . <newline> <newline> I stood up , turned towards the jeep and just stared . <newline> <newline> “ Grunt , get back in the jeep , were running off schedule , ” the Head officer yelled at me . <newline> “ Yes sir , right away sir , ” was all that came out of my mouth . As I walked back to the jeep , pictures of the dog ’ s death ran through my head . I stepped up into the cab and sat down . We drove off , but I didn ’ t keep watch like I was supposed too . My eyes were fixed on the dog . <newline>

Dickbutt ... That was the first thing reddit was to do with their recent purchase of the moon . <newline> <newline> `` We 're going to etch dickbutt with freakin ' lasers across the surface of the moon ! '' cried one post with over 100,000 upvotes . <newline> <newline> There was n't much else they could do with the moon . I mean , reddit just spent all our money buying the floating rock . The government required an astronomical amount of funds for the purchase and the rest went to legal fees from all the other countries suing reddit for purchasing something that belongs to humanity . <newline> <newline> `` We are humanity ! '' exclaimed a majority of reddit users , which eventually won us the case . <newline> <newline> Dickbutt was only the beginning though . Thanks to an anonymous donor that built and sent a huge laser to reddit as a secret santa gift . They used it to mark reddit 's newly found territory . More memes were to come and in great detail . Soon after , the surface of the moon was a hub of graffiti of all and every meme that had ever found it 's way through reddit . <newline> <newline> People exclaimed that this was a travesty , that the purchase should have never happened if ... this ... was to come of it . After all , the moon in all it 's majesty , was a symbol to humanity and a first glimpse for all mankind to the wonders of the universe . Now it 's just a floating wad of toilet paper for the internet to smear its shit onto . <newline> <newline> It was n't long after that reddit sent out a satellite to orbit around the moon . It acted as a mirror to etch on the dark side of the moon . Now it 's covered in the most prolific and vile things to ever posted on reddit . <newline> <newline> I 'm not sure what reddit has planned to do next with the moon . Some speculate that we 're sending robots to mine the ores and riches of the moon . They think that reddit can become vastly rich off the spoils of the moon , share that wealth , and create of utopia on earth . Others think it 's a conspiracy . That the government now controls reddit and uses the graffiti as a front to cover what they 're actually doing . They say the government is going to colonize , mine , and weaponize the moon . No one really knows . <newline> <newline> I grew sick as to how `` big '' of an ordeal this became , what reddit has become . I deleted my account and tried to forget the whole ordeal and move on with my life . However , that was all in vain really , because whenever I look out to the night sky I see it , staring at me with his smug , glazed eyes and a wiener hanging out his butt . <newline> <newline> Dickbutt forever stands guard over humanity . <newline> <newline> <newline> Edit : Fixed a few sentences . <newline>

`` So basically , magic , '' said the bartender . The rest of the villagers murmured in agreement . <newline> <newline> I had stopped concealing my sighs hours ago . `` No . <<unk>> .

I mean , think about it . Yeah , so there 's these tiny living things that are so small that you ca n't see them ( but trust me they 're there ! ) that are attacking your body , which by the way is made up of billions of tiny things themselves , and when the bad tiny things get the better of your good tiny things , you get sick , and your body has these specialized tiny things that fight the bad tiny things and if those fighting tiny things win , then you get better . <newline> <newline> Fuck me , right ? I had actually succeeded in introducing <<unk>> . I did n't exactly know how to do that either , but I brought the pond water and milk to a boil before cooling it back down ( 'cause it kills the tiny bad things ! ) . The few people who looked passed my lunatic rantings and committed to trying my stuff were getting less sick from liquid , so I guess the process worked . I had a larger following now and they were listening to me . <newline> <newline> `` How about this , '' I said . `` So the lightning , that we create from ... uhm , this lightning creating station , travels through the metal wire that 's connected to every home , and is received by this glass ball that has this tiny piece of metal in it that glows from getting hot from the lightning and that 's electrical light for you . '' <newline> <newline> The villagers looked around at the candles and oil lanterns that lit the bar quite well , gave each other nods that seemed to say `` yeah we got this whole 'light ' thing down already , stop your lightning harnessing nonsense '' and turned back to me . <newline> <newline> `` So basically ... magic , '' said the bartender . <newline> <newline> `` Get me a key , '' I said over the ensuing rabble . `` And a kite . There 's a storm tonight and I 'll show you exactly what I mean . '' <newline> <newline> An old lady answered me . `` What 's a kite ?

`` How is this possible ? , '' I wonder staring at myself . Around me is a dusty rubble that was n't there seconds before . A seemingly little steam of blood that runs down my head drenched my hair partly in a sticky red mess where it had seeped in . She ... I ... ? am here for more than a few seconds . <newline> I reach out , `` is this for real ? , '' as my hand passes through ... <newline> I touch my own head wondering , how , again . I feel weird tingly but it did n't hurt at all . `` So this is how it ends ?

Inviting me to a bright warm light behind her .
The first time I met him , I was on a date at <unk> . <newline> <newline> He was an old man , his hair was a mess , and he was n't old enough to know anything , he had a small scar on his head , he wore a black robe , the only one that I could make out of his eyes . He was n't old enough to know what he was doing . I did n't know why he did n't know why he was gone , he did n't know why he was here , but the thing about the man was that he was n't old enough to know the truth , and so I walked out to the bathroom and checked his phone . <newline> <newline> It was a phone call . <newline> <newline> It looked like it was just another phone call . I looked at it for a few seconds , but I thought to myself , `` Why was that ? '' <newline> <newline> `` I 'm afraid I have a message that it is in my phone .

I never liked the idea that a man can get into a body and he has to be dead . That 's how he got into his body . I was always in the position to get the body to the morgue . I had to be sure that the man in the body was a little bit less than a child . <newline> <newline> I was never in the position to be alive , but I had no idea that if he was alive , he would be dead . He would be dead for a few days and I did n't mind the fact that he would be dead . <newline> <newline> I went to the morgue , found a small bag , and a little bit of blood . I was n't sure if he could take it , but I could n't see him in the morgue . <newline> <newline> I was n't sure what to expect . I was in my room , I knew it . I was n't sure if I would die , but I did n't care if I had any blood . <newline> <newline> I looked over at the man
I 've always had trouble deciding whether to help someone or not . I 'm always worried that I 'll be cumbersome while I help someone , so I tend to ignore the needs of others . It 's something that I 'm actively working on , and one of my main inspirations for improving my speed of assistance comes from this story that happened to me . <newline> <newline> I lived in Hong Kong back when I was a kid - out in the New Territories ( the <<unk>> ' area ) , and would take the bus home from school . The public transportation was and still is fantastic , so I was alone when I rode the double decker bus back home . When I got to the nearest station to my home , I began to walk towards the subway tunnel , which led to the pathway to my house . The path to my house was under this long canopy of trees , and was squeezed into a thin lane between the trees and a wall right behind the trees - basically you could only walk on this path . The path extended past this sort of village place , then went on towards a cul-de-sac . The cul-de-sac was where I lived , and took about an hour to get to . It was a long but nice walk . <newline> <newline> Unfortunately there were a lot of wild dogs around that area , and I had an almost pathological fear of dogs ( I think I was bitten by one when I was really young and I kept that fear ) . At that moment in time though I only ever heard the dogs ' barks ; at that moment I had never seen a wild dog . Today though , I spotted a dog lying on the pathway in front of me . First reaction was to be quiet and just step over it , since I did n't have enough space to go around . But when I actually got to the point of doing the act , I stopped . It was probably smarter to just wait for the dog to wake up and leave . So I turned around and began to walk back . But then I heard growling behind me . <newline> <newline> Somehow I had woken up the dog ( I think I stepped on it 's tail by accident ) , and it was mad at me . So , faced with the danger of being bitten , and with faded memories of other encounters with dogs rising up , I chose flight and began to run . Of course , my stubby legs could n't outrun the fully grown dog , and it caught up to me quickly . Realising the situation I was in , I decided to turn around and fight the dog . So I promptly tried to punch its nose with my right hand , but instead got it caught in the dog 's mouth . Fear of the dog was n't ruling me anymore , and I bit the dog back . Dog whimpers and runs away , but leaves me with a bleeding hand - and the possibility of a disease . It also hurt a lot and I was still an hour away from home . I was happy that my bag was safe and sound though . <newline> <newline> So I began to walk home . But about five to ten minutes after I began walking , I met a nanny ( they 're pretty common in Hong Kong ) . She had headgear , so she was from Indonesia . She was also pulling an empty little cart that was probably meant for groceries . When I walked up to her she made a gasping sound and began talking Cantonese to me . I was an expat 's child though and did n't understand . She then dropped her little trolley , and lifted me up in both of her arms . She stuttered out the words , `` Come with me , I have bandaids . '' I just nodded and let myself be carried off down the pathway . She lived in the village that the path passed by , and so only took a minute or so to reach . She brought me into her employer 's house and sat me down . She gave me a phone and motioned to call and said , `` Parents . '' Then she went into another room while I called my parents . <newline> <newline> I told my mom what happened , she sounded flustered and told me that she would come pick me up in her car . The nanny then came back from the room she was in and was holding some alcohol , some paper towels , and those long white , wrapping bandages . She wiped off the blood that caked my hand , and added a liberal amount of the medicinal alcohol . She honestly added too much in my opinion . It honestly stung more than the bite ... Anyways , she then wrapped those bandages around and told me to sit tight for my parents . My parents arrived , and I left . <newline> <newline> I guess some people might say everything the nanny did was expected , and that anyone would do such a thing . But she could have easily ignored me , and that 's what I probably would have done : I would think the person does n't want my help because that person is n't asking . The nanny 's speed of reaction , and her willingness to do all those medicinal acts will probably always be stuck in my mind . Even if what she did was minimal . She was just <<unk>> 's in trouble - > must help

Leaving the T.V . on , in case any emergency signals come through to wake him or provide explanation . <newline> <newline> He drifts to sleep and begins to dream . . . <newline> <newline> *BOOM* <newline> <newline> Jumping from his laying position in fright . The light of day filling the room , but no <<unk>> scream of an emergency broadcast could be heard . Just a faint rumble in the ears , almost imperceptible - like airliner flying over lower than usual . The T.V . is off . <newline> <newline> `` What the hell '' , said as if annoyed by the phenomena . <newline> <newline> `` I thought I left that on '' , turning his head toward the alarm clock . The faint rumble now becoming louder and the light of day slightly dimmer . <<unk>> AM ' <newline> <newline> `` What the hell is going on '' , said now with concern . <newline> <newline> The roar of a freight train now coming closer , consuming the audible space and Raul 's own ability to think . The light of day now burning brighter through the windows and with a faintly colored hue of shifting orange . Tripping over his shoes as he burst from the bed , Raul runs to the window . <newline> <newline> As he reaches for the curtain to see outside , to see what ever could be so loud and bright at three in the morning , he is ripped into by the burst of exploding glass . His body barely hitting the floor , his face hardly able to cope with a gesture of surprise , he is consumed in nuclear flame . <newline> <newline>

His eyes were as green as they ’ d been the day he was born . Jade . Shamrock . Emerald . Moss . Olive . Teal . I ’ d lived with him for almost 17 years , and I still couldn ’ t define them . They didn ’ t come from me or his father . They were simply green . <newline> <newline> The rest of him was smoky gray , transparent enough that if I looked straight at him , he wouldn ’ t be there anymore . He sat delicately on the couch , gazing at me . <newline> <newline> “ Mom. ” <newline> <newline> “ Charlie. ” <newline> <newline> His lips quirked up into a small smile , and he ran a hand through his messy hair . Even in death , that would not change . “ You know , I didn ’ t think you ’ d have the guts to do it . Take the drug , I mean . You were always against it. ” <newline> <newline> “ You ’ re my son , ” I said fiercely . “ I would do anything for you. ” <newline> <newline> His smile faded . “ You don ’ t have to anymore . I ’ m dead. ” <newline> <newline> His words sent a jolt through me , reminding me why I was there , using a drug I had so passionately fought against . <newline> <newline> “ Charlie ... ” <newline> <newline> He did not smile again . “ Mom , ” he said gently . “ Why did you come ? ” <newline> <newline> I felt my breath catch in my throat and thought of the empty pill bottle I ’ d found hidden under his pillow . I thought of how pale he ’ d been , and how cold his hands were . I thought of his laptop , still powered on , open to a blank Word document . <newline> <newline> “ Why did you do it ? ” <newline> <newline> “ Why did I kill myself , you mean ? ” <newline> <newline> “ Yes , ” I breathed . “ Why ? ” <newline> <newline> He looked as if my words both disturbed and shocked him . “ Mom , I ... I can ’ t explain . Not now . Please. ” <newline> <newline> “ Charlie. ” I worked to keep the emotion down . “ Charlie , <<unk>> ” <newline> <newline> “ Fine. ” His face set into a mask , and his green eyes - the only color left on him , hardened . “ Let me tell you why I killed myself . <newline> <newline> “ It was you . ”

It is the one sound that can shatter a parent . In the back of their mind , buried behind the mundane everyday worries and clutter hides the fear of hearing the sound of their child 's voice , their last earthly sound as it is ripped from their throat as they take their last breath . <newline> <newline> My son lay upon the grass , the knees of his stained and his trainers kicked off as he played . The picture of childish curiosity , his head thrown back to look up at the clouds and his soft voice called out the shapes his mind formed for him . I was lounging on the sun bed set up on the patio , reading the latest trashy paper back novel , I knew I should have kept a close eye on him however my mind was whisked away on romance and the pangs of lost loves that the novel inspired . What danger could possible happen to my son , even if I was not there in mind ? I believed my bodily presence would worn off any potential evil doers . <newline> <newline> The sound of his voice , one terrible long plea was all it took destroy me . <newline> <newline> `` Mummy ! '' He cried . It was the last sound , the last mark on earth that would hold the memory of my son . It would echo though the ages , as I now sit , burning itself into my consciousness . Least I forget my folly . <newline> A snake has wrapped itself around the arms of my son and plunged it 's venomous fangs into his tender , pale fresh as easily as a knife passes though butter . Vivid green with a body as thick as my son 's torso , this snake was fresh from the garden of Eden . Satan was taking my child from me , it seemed . It 's tail trashed on the ground , mocking me to save the Apple of my world . <newline> <newline> I gripped the hellish tail and pulled with all of my might , feeling the satisfying coil of my muscles as adrenaline surged though my body . It come free from my son with an odd squelch , red rivers oozed from the wound on his neck but I had a more pressing matter of Satan turning his wrath upon the only available Eve . <newline> <newline> It lunged forward like a bullet , it 's fangs getting stuck on the rubber <<unk>> of my shoe . A shovel that my husband had been using to do yard work was impaled in the ground , I grasped the hilt like it was Excalibur and brought it down upon the snake 's head . There was a sickening crunch and it was over , the life drained out of the snake 's coils , lifeless as a piece of string . <newline> <newline> I turned toward the body of my son with relief coursing though me , I had won ! I had saved my son ! I fell to my knee beside him and scooped him tiny body into my arms , watching how his head lolled to the side as it was made of lead . <newline> <newline> If you have ever had a moment where your mind seems to disconnect and the pounding of your heart is all that you can hear . This is what that moment felt like , I could have died a thousand deaths in those few precious moments before it hit me . <newline> <newline> The sound of my Son 's voice pushed against my ear drums , a soft whisper that I had to strain to hear over the gasping on my breath and the tears that flooding down my cheeks . His plea sounded again , this time crescendoing to a ear spilling scream . <newline> <newline> `` <<unk>> ! '' <newline> <newline> I looked down at the life my husband and I had created , our own piece of heaven that Satan had taken from me . His lips were still , no voice was coming from his throat . <newline> <newline> His voice screamed again and then I knew I would be hearing it until the day I died . It would not stop until it has engraved itself on the inside of my skull and the whole world would hear of my shame . <newline> <newline> My next door neighbours laughter danced over the fence . A twisted benediction for my Son 's body .
“ I thought you knew what you were doing ! ” <newline> <newline> The panic in my voice was clear despite the blaring of alarms that sought to drown it out . Trying to keep my composure , I held the bag now filled to the brim with money with one hand , and tightened my grip on my rifle with the other . <newline> <newline> “ Of course I do ! Just keep moving ! ” <newline> <newline> Ryan turned and started to rush down another grimy maintenance corridor , his head spinning wildly this way and that looking for any sort of escape route . It had been far too long since we had blown the safe and grabbed the cash - we should have been long gone by now . Instead , we were still stuck here , pushing against locked door after locked door , trapped like rats in a cage . <newline> <newline> “ But… ” <newline> <newline> “ Shut up ! We are getting out of here and getting far away , and then you can pay those medical bills and your family will be cured , ok ? Just get off my case for a minute ! ” <newline> <newline> Mentioning my family only made me feel worse . They were the only reason that I had got myself into this mess in the first place . Not like I would have taken any other course of action , mind you - they meant everything to me . To see them all dying slowly of that illness , with my wreck of a life and lack of a job making me unable to get the help they <<unk>> I would do this all again if I had to . I would just hope that next time it would go more smoothly . <newline> <newline> “ Finally ! ” <newline> <newline> Ryan ’ s excited cry snapped me out of my thoughts . A set of heavy doors had finally swung open in response to his attempts , and there up ahead was another set , the sun peeking through their edges , the glow they created almost beckoning us towards them . <newline> <newline> “ Go go GO ! ” he shouted , but I did not need telling . Breaking into a run , I darted past him as fast as I could , reached the end of the corridor and pushed upon the door . A brief flicker of joy erupted inside of me as they opened to my touch . It was crushed almost instantly as my eyes took in in everything around me – the dazzling sunlight . The endless rows of police cars and flashing red and blue lights surrounding the building . And the dozens of police officers hidden behind them , guns raised , ready to fire at anything that appeared in their crosshairs . <newline> <newline> I did n't hear the shots get fired . I only felt the pain , so sudden , so agonisingly painful . The force of the shots sent me spinning to the ground , my head cracking harshly off the concrete , a small puddle of crimson splattering down next to my body . <newline> <newline> “ MICHAEL ! ” <newline> <newline> Even through the pain I heard that shout , and my vision remained clear . I could see Ryan coming out the door , the mix of terror , grief and confusion etched so perfectly on to his face it looked as though it had been carved there . Then he too was struck by another volley of shots , blood starting to rush from his chest almost instantly . As I watched him also fall to the ground the realisation came to me so clearly , even though my thoughts were fading away – he had never known what he was doing . He was trying to help me and help my family , but not with a grand scheme or any sort of plan , just with his instincts and the desperate hope that everything would turn out ok. <newline> <newline> And that was the first of the three lies . The other two merely followed as a consequence - we were never going to get out of here . I was never going to be able to help my family . Guilt and sadness flooded through my dying body , but I was comforted by the fact I knew I had tried . I had not just let them die . As my vision blurred , I took in Ryan ’ s body one more time . I held no anger towards him and the lies he had told me – he had only tried to help . The choices I had made were my own , and even though they led to this , at least I had made them . I had tried to make things better . <newline> <newline> With this in mind , I closed my eyes , and made peace with God . <newline>

Joe was your average working nerve cell . Every day ( and night , his shifts were rather long actually ) Joe sat down at the sensor panel and sent out the readings he saw .

My name is Dr. <<unk>> <<unk>> , and I will recount the tale of the Breach that changed our world . <newline> <newline> I remember when the Fourth Wall came down . I was in my living room , browsing people 's artistic creations on my 55 '' <<unk>> , when my screen became an <<unk>> long hallway , much like when you face two mirrors towards each other . From within came the sound of elephants , clashing of swords , and all manner of rainforest wildlife . <newline> <newline> I wisely jumped out of the way before they came out , destroying half my house . <newline> <newline> The most logical thing to do was alert my friends to this bloody awesome scene , and then call the insurance company and police . However , the network was being swamped ; everyone else was thinking the same thing , as it was happening in their living rooms as well ! <newline> <newline> Reports started coming in : people dressed in strange costumes , talking strange languages . There were mutated creatures and high-energy explosions throughout the globe , which were thankfully confined to <<unk>> desert and mountainous regions . <newline> <newline> No one really put two and two together until they saw a wizard , with a lightning bolt for a scar , casting a thunderbolt in Trafalgar square . Or until a <<unk>> of pointy-eared fair folk were found in a national park , speaking a foreign yet vaguely familiar language . <newline> <newline> Either there was a global convention , or the world of fiction merged with ours . <newline> <newline> The Breach has no physical form . There was no crater formed on impact , nor a collision trajectory viewable from space . Rather than coming from the outside , it seemed to have come from the inside , through the mediums we used to craft those worlds : books , pens , tablets , and even paintings were gates and keys . <newline> <newline> Half the world did n't know what to do . <newline> <newline> The other half , we of the younger generations , knew exactly what to do . <newline> <newline> Every creative writer and artist became an architect . With their tools at hand , they could summon forth fantastic creatures , and rearrange a piece of the world to their own image . Art and words became their spell circles and incantations . Brush and pen became their wands . <newline> <newline> We discovered that how big a person 's alterations could be was strongly dependent on their level of delusion and artistic ability . The more practical you were , the less power you had in this New World . Naturally , anyone who 's won the lottery , received an inheritance , or suddenly found themselves attractive can tell you what this 'll do to a person . <newline> <newline> War broke out . First it was between the <<unk>> and the Dreamers , as they called themselves . The <<unk>> quickly lost ground , and now live on reservations . Then there were fights between the Dreamers , divided by canon . <<unk>> became mercenaries , their <<unk>> field ' only extending to a small radius around their person . Those who subscribed to particular canons could form <<unk>> , and entire cities could congregate together to essentially change the laws , within a six mile radius , to suit the consensus . <newline> <newline> But though laws of physics can be changed , there is still a meta to metaphysics . The newest academic field is <<unk>> Physics , which analyses the large-scale phenomena that result when different canons collide . What happens if two cities have <<unk>> Delusion Fields , but are only three miles apart ? Will they cleanly integrate like most Modern stories do ? Or collide violently when you cross Final Fantasy and Dead or Alive ( Monty <<unk>> has been elevated to patron deity of that region ) . <newline> <newline> And magic ! <<unk>> and Functional magic paradigms have mutually exclusive clauses . What does the hybrid look like ? <newline> <newline> This is truly an exciting time we live in . I hope I live long enough to record it !

The first time I saw him , I was sitting on my bed in the middle of a busy street , watching my parents watch the news . <newline> <newline> I was sitting on a sofa , watching the news when a man in a black suit walked up to me and said , <newline> <newline> `` I 'm sorry . My dad 's been in a coma for a few months now . His father has been a very bad person , and he 's been very good at keeping his family alive '' <newline> <newline> I was confused , and then I thought about how I was going to die . <newline> <newline> `` I have n't heard of him in some time , but I 've always been a big fan of him . I 'm sorry he 's hurt his dad , but he 's so bad at keeping his family alive '' <newline> <newline> I had n't heard of him , but when he said he was sick , there was no way of saying that he was hurt . <newline> <newline> `` It 's been a while '' he said , and he started
The password was n't so simple . It required a sequence of well-timed thoughts , followed a series of moods , and then a frequency inaudible to the human ear . <newline> <newline> And yet , I cracked it . The possibilities opened up before me , vast and terrifying in all their permutations . The longer I stared into the truth , the reasons , the very secrets behind everything , the more I realized that neither I nor anyone else could properly harness the immediacy of all knowledge . <newline> <newline> Ignorance was n't necessarily bliss , but there was a joy in gradual discovery . Humanity was meant to play this game without cheat codes . <newline> <newline> I changed the password before wiping my memory clean .
`` <unk> ! You 've got the whole idea to put in place on the computer ! '' <newline> <newline> `` Yes , but I 've got to make sure you 're ready to make the decision , '' I answered .

He had a clipboard , and he was looking very confused . He looked like a man with nothing in a lab coat , and he seemed like he was looking for something more important . <newline> <newline> `` You 've got a plan ! It 's gon na be a long day , and I 'll have the plan . '' <newline> <newline> `` No , I know , that 's what I 'm going to do . '' <newline> <newline> `` Alright , okay . I 'm going

'' <newline> <newline> The man looked at the phone . `` Why would anyone want to talk about it ? '' <newline> <newline> `` The whole universe is a mess , '' the man said , `` the <unk> is the first to speak , and the <unk> is the first to talk .

Blackness , nothing but endless blackness . It feels as if I 'm falling , yet rising at the same time , yet neither . Something feels familiar , but what does familiar mean ? I ca n't hold on to thoughts . They float through my mind like fog and then blink away , just to float back in from another direction . Yet amongst the empty , I feel peace . <newline> <newline> Then slowly a blowing wind begins . Where from I can not tell , there is no up , down , left , right . It picks up pulling me towards a bright light , I grasp at the nothing trying to resist . Like a tornado the wind pulls me up into the air towards the light . I do n't know how but I know the light is wrong , I must avoid the light . But as certain as death , I 'm sucked through to the other side . <newline> <newline> Noise , so much noise . Battle , there are people fighting . Lights , beams , magic shooting everywhere . Someone is yelling , yelling at me I think . A short long haired woman with pointy ears and a white robe is yelling at me . <newline> <newline> `` Into the fray <<unk>> , the Alliance needs you ! '' <newline> <newline> I 've been revived . Again and again they bring me back , and every time I die . I ca n't remember the order of the deaths but they sit there in my mind . A wolf tearing out my guts as I scream in pain . A bolt of lightning arcing from the sky electrocuting me . Always surrounded by enemies , always dying . <newline> <newline> I must get out of here , away from this endless cycle . I turn away from the battle looking for my escape , but I can not move . <newline> <newline> The voice has returned . It never truly leaves . I feel my feet guiding me back towards the battle . I try to stop as I have a thousand times before but it is no use . The voice carries me forward . I can hear it muttering in the back of my mind in a strange language *That guy is so op since the last patch , its fucking stupid . * I know not what the words mean , yet they send a shiver down my spine . <newline> <newline> I long for the days spent doing heroic tasks for my homeland . When I collected 15 boar tusks for <<unk>> 's new house in the Forest of <<unk>> . When I defeated the evil ice witch of the <<unk>> Tundra . Heroic deeds for people who need help . Instead I am dragged to and from death in this endless bloodbath . There is no end . <newline> <newline> I plunge into the fray with the fury of one who can do nothing else . <newline> <newline> <newline>
The old man sat in his chair , his head in his hands , his back resting on the <unk> of the table . He could n't help but smile , his eyes wide . The man sat in his seat , the chair still still in his lap . He sat up . <newline> <newline> `` I 'm sorry , '' the old man said , `` But what have I done to deserve this ? '' <newline> <newline> The old man nodded , `` I 'm sorry , I 've never felt like this . '' He paused , `` But I 've never felt like it before . '' <newline> <newline> The old man chuckled , `` You have n't been in this place for a long time , do you ? '' <newline> <newline> The old man shrugged , `` But I 've never felt like this . '' He looked down at his hands , his head resting on his lap . A long time ago , he was in a state of distress . <newline> <newline> `` But , '' the old man paused , `` I 'm so sorry . '' <newline> <newline>
`` Here 's you lunch , Commander ! '' <newline> <newline> Said the security guard , tossing a tray full of grey paste into the nearby cell . The prisoner that resided lay upright on his bed , staring at the ceiling . Yet another Super Villain caught by a Super Hero . <newline> <newline> `` You 'll be wanting some sauce with that , am I right ! ? '' <newline> <newline> Yelled the guard as he waddled away down the corridor , laughing boisterously as he turned to meet his colleagues in the <<unk>> room . <newline> <newline> `` When I get outta here fatty , you 'll be eating those words '' <newline> Whispered Commander , sighing as he watched the grey gunk pulsate on the plastic tray . `` Food like that should never move '' he thought , `` and it especially should n't be doing that '' . He threw a nearby book at the tray hoping the food would scurry away to disgust some other poor soul , because he sure as hell was n't going to eat it . <newline> Suddenly the cell began to vibrate . The tray on the floor , the bed , the shelves , everything began to move and shake . The Commander covered his eyes as sparks began to flash in the middle of the cell , and a blinding light followed from an opening in thin air . The light grew brighter as the opening grew wider and a loud creaking noise followed , echoing down the corridor . The light subsided and a tall figure caped and clad in majestic armor , stepped out of the opening . A wave of his hand caused the creaking to start again , before <<unk>> as the opening closed itself . The figure stood up straight and his eyes glowed a bright blue through his helmet visor . <newline> <newline> `` Greetings fellow Villain ! '' Bellowed the strange figure , `` fear not , for I am your salvation ! '' <newline> <newline> The Commander stared in awe at this strange being who materialised before him , hundreds of questions flooding his mind , but no words could escape his mouth . <newline> <newline> `` I see you are in need of answers '' said the knight `` well I shall give you 3 questions so be quick about it , I have n't got all day '' <newline> <newline> The Commander snapped out of his trance began to stutter . <newline> <newline> `` Er -- erm well . I-I-I guess my first question is how the hell did you get in here ! ? '' Asked the Commander , now rising from his bed . <newline> `` Oh , I was n't expecting that question first , but very well ! '' Said the knight , holding out his armored hand to demonstrate . `` That was what I like to call my Doorway . I can create small doorways from one place to another '' he said , creating a small portal in the space above his palm , complete with creak and light , like a door opening into nothingness . `` I simply opened a door from my lair to here , and we 'll here I am . Please do not ask me how it 's done . I have neither the time nor the patience to explain the power to every villain I free '' <newline> <newline> `` Free ! ? '' <<unk>> the Commander , his eyes widening in excitement <newline> <newline> `` Okay ! Second question ! That 's right , I 'm here to free you , you poor sad man ! '' The figure laughed , brushing aside his tattered cape and revealing a large leather-bound book . The book appeared to be old but upon close inspection , it was just made to look old . He opened the book and cleared his throat . `` Now then , you are The Con -- '' <newline> <newline> `` Wait wait wait , who the hell are you ? '' Interrupted the Commander <newline> <newline> `` Oh , okay then , third question it is . '' He answered closing the book again . I , dear boy , am the <<unk>> ! Master of Locks ! Conjurer of Doors ! And the KEY to the victory of the Villains in this city ! '' He opened the book once more , this time equipping a pair of reading glasses in front of his visor , and reading from it nonchalantly . `` Ahem ! Now then , you are The <<unk>> Commander , correct ? You were attempting to rob a safety deposit bank on the 18th of July , exclaiming that the law would never , and I quote , Ketchup with you , when you were foiled by leader of the Solar Squadron : Final Flare . That right ? '' <newline> <newline> `` ... ... yes '' admitted The <<unk>> Commander , begrudgingly . <newline> <newline> `` Right then ! '' Said the <<unk>> , slamming the book shut and taking his glasses off , `` well despite your below-average <<unk>> success rate , and your ranking in the Villain 's guild database , I have a feeling that the villains of this city will still need your unique ... ... ... skills ? During the final face off with the heroes that plague this wretched place . Do n't you want to even the score with that Final Flare . This is your chance , boy ! '' <newline> <newline> `` Final face off ? Even the score ? The heck are you talking about ? '' Questioned The Commander <newline> <newline> `` I 'm sorry but all three questions have been answered , but do n't worry all will be explained once the villains have all gathered '' he waved
`` Hey , it 's time for this . '' I said as I walked up to my desk and started my usual routine . <newline> <newline> `` I 'll have a call for you , '' he replied , with a smile . <newline> <newline> `` I do n't think I 've ever seen that before . '' I said . <newline> <newline> `` It 's your favorite , you know ? '' he said . <newline> <newline> `` I 'm sorry , I just think you know . '' I said , as I took his hand and he turned around . <newline> <newline> `` I 'm sorry , but you know what ? You know you do n't have to do this . '' he said , as he grabbed a pen and put it on top of my desk . <newline> <newline> `` I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry , I do n't mean to upset you . '' I said , as I looked up at him . <newline> <newline> `` It 's just that you have a job for us , right ? '' I said , as I looked at him .
A small man stood on a bench , his hands on his knees and eyes wide open . He stared at the sky , his eyes closed and eyes shut . The world was not that big , and it was not even a bright one . <newline> <newline> He stared at the sky , his eyes locked on a sky , the sky was not just a light but an object . A small , small , black object . <newline> <newline> He looked at the figure , and he felt a chill run down his spine . He wondered if this was the object , but he wondered if the object was the object . <newline> <newline> He had n't even had a chance to look into it , and he could n't help it . He wondered if the object had been the thing . <newline> <newline> He had n't seen it in a while , and he was n't quite sure what to do . <newline> <newline> He could n't help but look back at the sky . He was n't sure if he had n't seen it . His eyes were n't closed , though
You 've got to be kidding me . A cat ? Of all things to be reborn as , I 'm a black freakin ' cat . The very ( creepy ) creature I feared the most when I was alive . When I was human . Before the bastard killed me . <newline> <newline> I race past a mirror before I can catch a glance and freak myself out . Do cats have heart attacks ? I hope so . <newline> <newline> What 's this ? Why is he here ? Please tell me I 'm not in his house . <newline> <newline> I am . <newline> <newline> `` Here kitty , kitty ... '' <newline> <newline> The bastard 's in his boxers dumping a can of fishy mush into a plastic bowl . I stare at him <<unk>> . Does he really expect me to the lick that up with my twisted shrunken cat mouth ? His hand 's in my fur now , stroking my head . He barely held my hand in public when we were together and now he 's petting my neck like I 'm the most loved thing on this sick planet . I mean , really ? A cat . Why not a piano or a violin ? At least when someone played me , something beautiful would come out . Not like when this bastard played me when I was alive . When I was human . Before he 'd killed me . <newline> <newline> He 's calling me Charlie , but my name is certainly not Charlie . I wonder if his wife , you know , the woman he did n't tell me about when we were dating , likes cats . I wonder if she 's allergic . I wonder if she 's here . <newline> <newline> I hear a sneeze . One <<unk>> and cuter than the one this bastard makes . He blesses her . For the first time I 'm glad my new face is permanently smug and <<unk>> indifferent . <newline> <newline> I want to skip away into a room ( a closer would work too ) but I do n't know my way around . He 'd only invited me here once before . <newline> <newline> He 's calling me Lucille now . No , that 's not me either . I turn and see another cat with a creamy orange coat waltz by , head high , pink nose drawn to the ceiling . But I 'm not as afraid of her as I would have been when I was alive . When I was human . Before he 'd killed me . I see a glimpse of myself in Lucille 's devilish eyes . <newline> <newline> `` Hmph ! '' she says , `` At least he 'd cut a key for me . I can move around here with my eyes closed . '' <newline> <newline> It 's the way her <<unk>> mouth does n't move as I hear her words that does it for me . My heart feels like it 's being squeezed tighter than the bastard 's hands around my throat . He was just trying to keep me quiet . But I 'd kept screaming at the threshold and his wife was still sitting at the dining room . He 'd squeezed too tightly . Now my lungs feel too tight . <newline> <newline> One life down . Eight to go . <newline>
I wake in a hospital room in a hospital room , and my head aches . I have been here for a long time , and I 'm not sure if I can do anything . I 'm not sure if I want to die , or to die . I 've been here for a long time . <newline> <newline> I look around the room . <newline> <newline> I 've been here a long time . I 've been here a long time . I do n't remember . <newline> <newline> I have been here a long time . I 've been here a long time . I have been here a long time . I 've been here a long time . <newline> <newline> I 've been here and here for a long time . <newline> <newline> I remember when I was here . <newline> <newline> I remember when I was here . I was here for the first time . I remember when I was here , when I was a boy , and then I was here , when I was here . I was here , and I 'm here , and I 'm here
It was all a dream . <newline> <newline> The first time it happened , I was in a hospital bed . I had been awake for a long time . The pain was coming . <newline> <newline> I could n't see my wife and kids , the doctors were just waiting to tell me how much my heart had been ripped out in the last month . I was in a hospital in a hospital and I was in the hospital . <newline> <newline> But the pain was too strong , too intense to be alive . I had gone into a dream and was on my deathbed . The pain was too great . I was in a hospital and I could n't move . <newline> <newline> I did n't see my son anymore . He was in the hospital in a hospital . His name was <unk> , he was a doctor . He was n't a doctor . He was an <unk> . He was a doctor . <newline> <newline> It was n't a dream . <newline> <newline> I was in a hospital . I could n't see my wife . She was n't in the hospital
“ Oh my God , I have to do this . ” The villain looked at the hero with the look of an idiot who was just trying to make the hero laugh , he had already done it and he was trying to stop it . “ What if you think I ’ m crazy enough to make him laugh like that ? ” <newline> <newline> “ What if you ’ re crazy enough to have a villain laugh , he is a <unk> ” The villain was now sitting at the table , watching the villain , the hero was now sitting at the table , he was about to say something , but a man with a gun was sitting across from him , the villain was sitting at the table , his face was covered in blood and he was staring at the villain , “ You know , I ’ m just thinking about how much I hate you . I ’ m just not sure how you know this , but you know , I ’ m not sure what to do with you . You know , you can do that . I
`` What the fuck are you talking about ? '' <newline> <newline> `` I was a superhero , and now I am a super hero ! '' <newline> <newline> `` You 're telling me , you 're going to take this seriously ? '' <newline> <newline> `` I did what you said , I killed a guy in a car crash ! '' <newline> <newline> `` I do n't think I was a superhero ! I was a superhero ! '' <newline> <newline> `` You 're telling me you killed a guy ! ? '' <newline> <newline> `` I 'm not telling you that ! '' <newline> <newline> `` What the fuck is wrong with you , dumbass ? You 're telling me that you 've killed a guy ? '' <newline> <newline> `` I 'm telling you this ! '' <newline> <newline> `` That 's not what you said ! '' <newline> <newline> `` What ? You said you killed a guy ? '' <newline> <newline> `` No , no , you did . I did n't kill anyone . I killed a guy ! '' <newline> <newline> `` Well , that 's not what I said . ''
`` OMG , you guys , '' The Prick crossed his legs and arms , leaning back in his chair and slouched . `` How many times do I have to say <<unk>> ? '' His <<unk>> voice pitched so high that several officers stuck a finger ( or two ) in their sensitive ear holes . `` I 'm not a bad guy , Super <<unk>> is . '' <newline> <newline> Commissioner L. <<unk>> squinted her eyes at the supervillain . He had tried to look imposing with his large <<unk>> helmet that pointed straight up ( though some would say to the side and then stand a little stiffer afterwards ) , but all he did was look and act like a dick . Still , he managed to get into these situations day after day , week after week . He was more of an annoyance sometimes when she had to talk to him like this . Everytime she locked him up , he found a way to get out and wind up in the same messes . He was ruining her city and making a mockery of her while he was at it . <newline> <newline> Thank goodness for Super <<unk>> . <<unk>> leaned back against the reflective mirrored wall , arching an eyebrow . Two detectives stood to the side , mustaches twitching and ready to pounce if The Prick tried anything on their boss . `` Lem me ask you something , Prick . '' <newline> <newline> `` It 's `` The Prick '' , '' he mumbled back , effectively pouty now . <newline> <newline> She ignored him . `` Lem me ask you , Prick , why would Super <<unk>> do such a thing ? Why not join forces with you , or just take over the world already ? Why is he such a nice guy and saves puppies and cats in trees when he 's not dealing with the trash , '' she looked pointedly at him . <newline> <newline> `` I keep telling you , <<unk>> baby , he 's got a master plan set in place . He wants your guard down , he wants to catch you with your panties down- '' <newline> <newline> `` Hey , settle down , '' one of the detectives hollered , starting for him . The other one held him back , barely . <newline> <newline> `` Look , every time you see me is another failure to stop him . Do you know how close he is to putting us all in concentration camps ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Now why would he do that ? '' <newline> <newline> `` <<unk>> . It 's a German word . Ever wonder why he picked German ? Because he 's Hitler 's <<unk>> ! In his head , he 's a Nazi Jesus Christ with the power to get rid of everyone that does n't fit his uncle 's idea of `` pure '' . I 'm the only one that can stop him . '' <newline> <newline> <<unk>> slowly blinked at him and yawned . `` And last time it was <<unk>> - as in poltergeist - as in he 's a ghost ' ... '' <newline> <newline> `` Uh , '' The Prick got a little red and straightened up , fidgeting in his seat . `` Yeah , I was wrong before but THIS time I definitely know his backstory and he really is trying to take over the world- '' <newline> <newline> `` <<unk>> '' <newline> <newline> `` <<unk>> , guys ... '' <newline> <newline> `` Take him to his cell . Time for him to get processed again . '' <newline> <newline> `` You got it , Commissioner . '' <newline> <newline> `` <<unk>> , baby , you got ta believe meeeee ... '' <newline> <newline> <<unk>> pinched the bridge of her nose and sighed . Why did she even bother asking anymore ? <newline> <newline> Outside the police building though , a figure floated by with a red cape flying in the wind . He smiled , twitching his faint facial hair that grew just above the center of his lip . Soon , he thought . Soon .
“ We 're going to have to tell you how we got this job , ” the old man said , his face pale and wrinkly , his eyes bloodshot and bloodshot . <newline> <newline> “ We 're going to have to tell you how we got this job , ” the old man said , his hand reaching out for the gun . <newline> <newline> “ What do you mean ? ! ” the old man yelled . <newline> <newline> “ We 're going to have to tell you what you do to that bastard , ” the old man shouted . <newline> <newline> The old man 's face was pale , his face pale and his mouth wide and his eyes sunken . He had a gun in his hand that made him look like he was wearing it for a long time . <newline> <newline> “ What do you mean ? ” the old man said . <newline> <newline> “ What do you mean ? Why is it that we just got this job ? ” the old man said , his eyes wide and his hand still shaking . <newline> <newline> The old man looked at

Leave Out All The Rest - Linkin Park <newline> <newline> I had a dream last night . A dream I went missing . *She* was so scared ... so freaking scared . She thought I killed myself . She thought I was dead . But no one would listen to her . Why ? Cause no one cared . But that was just a dream . <newline> <newline> I woke up this morning feeling depressed , as usual . I 've been like this for a long time . That 's why I 'm writing you this note . If you 're asking me , I want you to know that my time has come . And my suffering will be over . But when that happens , please , forget the wrong that I 've done . Help me leave behind some reasons for people to miss me . Leave out all the rest . Leave out all of the pain I 've caused . I live with this guilt , and I ca n't take it anymore . Guilt that never leaves my heart . Forget what I 've done . Forget what I 've done to them . Forget what I 've done to you . Remember the good in me . Please . I 'm begging you . Do n't resent me . And if you 're ever feeling empty , keep me in your memory . I 'll always be in your heart . <newline> <newline> Do n't be afraid , darling . I 've taken my beating . I 've suffered long enough . I may be strong on the surface , but not all the way through . I 've never been perfect , but neither have you . Forget all the hurt inside you 've learned to hide so well . Stop pretending there 's someone who can save me from myself . I ca n't be who you are . <newline> <newline> Goodbye .
`` What the hell ? !

He sat at the tiny dinner table across from her , both of them smiling in the light chill of September , a plate of pasta a day old between them . It was just a bit cold as he forked it down , but her smile filled him with the missing warmth . She laughed at how stupid he looked with doughy tentacles hanging out of his mouth . He grinned a sauce coated grin . She talked for what seemed like hours , he just sat there looking at her smile . Her beautiful green irises staring at him . Always . Her brown hair she did n't have time to tidy before their little dinner party . The candle illuminated the little freckles in her cheeks , and he felt whole again . They were in their most casual clothes , they 'd shushed each other at the same time when they 'd got back to the apartment and went to change in separate rooms . Tired as they were , they walked out in the same clothes and laughed at each other . He in a plain grey sweater , she in the white one with the red speckles . He 'd puked on that one when they 'd first met . She teased him , saying she could still smell it . He laughed . <newline> <newline> <newline> The doorbell rang , interrupting the music he had playing in his head . He opened it . *Her ex ? What 's that metal <<unk>> he felt the heat of the bullet in the air . It flew past his unassuming face . He heard a thump from behind him , the tinkle of cutlery hitting the floor and the wet slap of pasta , halfway to mouth , following it . His face still frozen , he dropped his hands into his pockets . Desperately shuffling around as the revolver drew to a bead to his sweating forehead . <newline> <newline> Click . <newline> <newline> <newline> He sat at the tiny dinner table across from her , both of them smiling in the light chill of September . A plate of pasta between them , it was just a bit cold but her smile filled him with the missing warmth . She talked for what seemed like hours , he just sat there looking at her smile . Her beautiful green irises staring at him . Always . Her brown hair she did n't have time to tidy before their little dinner party .

Tired as they were , they walked out in the same clothes and laughed at each other . <newline> <newline> <newline> The doorbell rang . It could n't be , he 'd moved them away . It 'd have to be someone else , right ? <<unk>> them on the move , however sudden it 'd been , only the next door neighbours would know . He got up to answer the second ring , legs shaking . She asked him if he was feeling alright . The door burst open , kicked down , a revolver was drawn in the candlelight . <newline> <newline> <newline> Click . <newline> <newline> <newline> He sat at the tiny coffee table across from her , both of them smiling in the light chill of September . A plate of pasta between them , it was just a bit cold but her smile filled him with the missing warmth . The room was empty save for two chairs and a vacant old sofa . He said that each other was all they needed . He 'd scrounged up enough money to buy a house in the country , he 'd scrounged up enough courage to face her . She agreed , a bit hesitant , but he could feel her glow of approval underneath . She would follow him to the ends of the earth , he would follow her to the end of time . There they sat in the dark of a candle , she seemed a little gloomy leaving the city but she tried her best for him . They sat sharing leftovers from yesterday , when they were still in the city . He 'd wanted to leave as soon as possible . <newline> <newline> <newline> There was a knock on the door , breaking the conversation . His heart sank . He sat there , motionless , with noodles impaled on a fork in the air between plate and mouth . She got up , he started coughing out sobs , trying to quickly down the food before it happened . He heard a gunshot down the hall . <newline> <newline> <newline> Click . <newline> <newline> <newline> They were at a train station , he 'd convinced her that his family wanted to meet her . That they 'd be ecstatic to see her again . His little sister especially . She had blushed at first but followed up with a sarcastic hand wave , pretending to be flush with embarrassment . She saw right through him , but he 'd asked for it and she did n't mind all that much . She had a paid vacation saved up at the office , so they did n't mind either . Together they stood on the platform wrapped in their scarves and their jackets , giggling giddily . Both of them were filled with anxiety , but with different kinds . He heard the station bell chime out its robotic ping , the train was coming in . He gestured for them to get ready . She , with false haughtiness
I was in the middle of a small park , a little boy , sitting in the park . I was on the bench , with the grass around me and the trees below me . He was sitting next to me , and it was the only thing in the world I had ever seen , the grass that was the only thing that was on me , but there was nothing to see . <newline> <newline> I stood , and the little boy was gone , and the little boy was gone , but the little boy was gone , and he was gone . I could see the little boy , and the little boy , the little boy , and the little boy , the little boy , was gone . I was a little boy , and I was a little boy . <newline> <newline> I was alone . I was alone . <newline> <newline> I was alone . <newline> <newline> I was alone , for a little long time , when I was alone , and I was alone , and alone , but alone . I was alone . <newline> <newline> I was
Needless to say this was the strangest job interview I 'd ever had , and it had n't even started yet . I almost considered not showing up , but as a broke kid with just a bachelor 's degree , I could n't look a gift horse in the mouth . I walked into the lobby of the hotel , feeling awkward as hell , my cheap suit making me feel out of place . I 'd been told to go to the conference room , and of course I did n't know where that was . <newline> <newline> I was on my way to the front desk to ask when the elevator dinged open , catching my attention . A man stepped out , tall , handsome , stylish suit , and a pair of sleek black sunglasses . He took one look at me and stepped back in surprise . `` Michael ? '' he asked . <newline> <newline> `` Um ... yeah . '' I said , a little uncertain . <newline> <newline> `` Goddamn man . '' He said grinning . `` I was n't expecting you for another ... '' He looked down at his watch , his very expensive looking watch . `` Fifteen minutes . That 's the right way to start an interview . Follow me . '' <newline> <newline> I followed him down a series of hallways before finally entering a small conference room . Inside there was an oval shaped table with eight or so chairs surrounding it . `` Alright so , my name 's Eli , I 'll be conducting your interview today . '' He said as he pulled out a chair for me . `` You can go ahead and read through this packet , it 'll give you all the basic information of the job you 're interviewing for . '' He dropped a large manilla envelope he 'd been carrying in front of me with a thud and placed a clipboard in front of the seat across from me . `` I.. '' he said continuing . `` will go grab a couple bottles of water and ... '' he patted himself up and down for a moment . `` a pen . '' <newline> <newline> He turned to walk out . `` Go ahead and read the packet , I 'll answer any questions you have when I get back . '' <newline> <newline> `` <<unk>> '' I called back as he closed the door behind him . <newline> <newline> I stared down at the envelope in front of me . It was thick , very thick , what had I gotten myself into ? I folded up the metal clip with ease but found that the flap was glued shut , goddamnit . I worked at it for a second , being careful not to rip it . I finally managed to open it and let out a satisfied `` Aha . `` , but instantly there was a loud pop and smoke began to pour out of the envelope . `` What the fuck ! '' I shouted as I dropped the envelope on the table . <newline> <newline> More smoke continued to pour out of it as I backed away to the door . I tried the handle but found that it must have been locked from the outside . I rammed my shoulder against it , calling for help , as the room continued to fill with smoke , I was coughing violently , my lungs burning . I stopped for a moment , trying to catch my breath , when I noticed my vision going blurry . I held my hand up in front of my face and found I could barely make out my individual fingers . `` What the fuck . '' I mumbled as I slowly collapsed to my knees as my vision finally went , feeling delirious . I passed out . <newline> <newline> I felt something hard pressed around my mouth and nose . There was a steady beep coming from my left . I was propped up slightly , but laying down . Slowly I opened my eyes . I was nearly blinded by the white walls and bright lights that surrounded me , but almost instantly I felt my eyes adjust and make it bearable . `` You 're finally awake . About time kid . '' <newline> <newline> I turned my head to the right , finding Eli sitting in a chair against the , facing me . He 'd swapped out the suit for a set of doctor 's scrubs , but he still wore the black sunglasses and expensive watch . `` What did you do to me ? '' I mumbled . <newline> <newline> Eli smiled . `` We made you better . '' <newline> <newline> `` Wha- what do you mean ? '' <newline> <newline> Eli stood up and held a barber style mirror in front of me . `` See for yourself . '' <newline> <newline> I looked at my reflection and gasped in shock . My eyes . They looked almost like camera lenses . Gray and metallic throughout , a shiny black dot at the center , as I looked at them I could see them dilate , the center ring visibly rotating . `` My eyes . '' I whispered , barely able to overcome the shock . <newline> <newline> `` And that 's just the tip of the iceberg . '' Eli said , putting down the mirror . `` Of course you probably wo n't notice the rest of your upgrades until you 're back on your feet . '' <newline> <newline> `` Why did you do this to me ? '' I asked , suddenly angry . <newline> <newline> `` Because , '' Eli said , taking off his glasses . `` We need more people like us

I was in a hotel room , and I heard it over and over again . This time it was my wife , sitting in a chair , with her head in her hands , staring at the ceiling , and I watched her . She did n't seem to be able to move , and she just did n't seem to notice it . <newline> <newline> The first time I saw her had been in a warehouse in London , the second time I saw her and she would have stopped . <newline> <newline> The second time I saw her , I saw her sitting at the edge of the elevator , and I watched her . She did n't move , and I watched her as her body moved and I watched her . <newline> <newline> The second time I saw her , I saw her . <newline> <newline> She was sitting at a desk , looking at the floor . She was wearing a black suit . <newline> <newline> I looked at her and she was looking at the ceiling , her hair was disheveled and her hair was disheveled . <newline> <newline> When I saw her
*Ok , I 'll have a go at this . This is my first time and English is not my main language so ... be gentle : ) * <newline> <newline> It was a day like any other . People were going on about their business , each with their own thoughts , each one indifferent to one another . Then they all stopped to look at the globe of light . Some of them looked at those closest to them , in search of an answer . Others just stared at globe , slowly growing to be the size of an automobile , then a bus , then finally a small home . The light dimmed and through it was a passage to ... somewhere else . The other side was packed with people , mostly peasants , just as confused as the people on our side . They looked at us , and we looked back a them . Then they came through . <newline> <newline> The news talked about it for weeks . It was definitely a portal , one that led to another world . The people , the ones who came through , were being exiled from their small town after the invasion from the army of a neighbouring kingdom . Most of them looked like us , and their DNA was extremely similar to ours , so much that we were deemed to compatible with them . We sent scouts on the other side , scientists and soldiers , to inspect the world beyond , to decide if it was a risk . <newline> <newline> *** <newline> <newline> `` Sir , the opportunity is too big to pass up '' , said the General while looking at the numbers floating on the big , wall-mounted screen . <newline> <newline> `` That world , it 's so similar to ours . And its population , even with the technology they possess , what they call 'magic ' , they 're a thousand years beyond us in so many fields '' . The Scientist was standing by the general on this . `` They have a world that is mostly unpopulated , rich of resources and materials that we have never even imagined before . What they used to open that portal , that green rock they pulverize , it defies everything we know about physics . Its quantum properties alone are going to leap us forward a thousand years ... '' <newline> <newline> `` I know '' . The President looked preoccupied . <newline> <newline> `` Even after we sent that petty king and his army back where he came from , they did n't want to go back . They ... they like it here '' . The Scientist said . <newline> <newline> `` And we have no problem crushing whatever resistance we may encounter , sir '' . The General added . <newline> <newline> `` We do n't have to go to war , General . And we do n't know what the mutated ones can do '' . The Scientist was not pleased by the eagerness of the General , and neither was the President . <newline> <newline> `` General , we have sent an army away from a village , and unless we 're going to have to defend ourselves , we 're not going to take anything by force , '' the President stated starkly . `` Tell me about the mutated ones , Doctor '' . <newline> <newline> `` Well , the ones that came through , they call themselves mages , '' the Scientist said , `` I ... I would agree with them , at least to a point . They have a mutation , a genetic one , that seems to allow them to create and manipulate very powerful magnetic fields . They can set things on fire , create shock waves , levitate objects ... if we did n't know better , we would call it magic as well . And what they can do when they use that green rock ... they have opened a wormhole that cuts through the galaxy , and a stable one at that , without even knowing a thing about the laws of gravity , let alone relativity or quantum entanglement ... '' . <newline> <newline> `` Spare us your bullshit and get to the point , Doctor '' , the General intervened , `` how dangerous are they ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Well , they ... they did with their minds and their limited , even non-existent knowledge what we have n't been able to do with nuclear reactors and particle accelerators . What do you think , General ? That said , the ones that have come through , even the mutated ones , are adapting egregiously to our lifestyle and they seem to be very eager to share with us what they know . As I said , what they have is going to take us places we 've never imagined before . We just have to ... ask . '' <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline>
`` Sir , you 're in a bad mood , '' said the man . `` What was the point of this ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Just keep it quiet , '' said the man . `` I 'm not sure I believe in this . '' <newline> <newline> `` Sir , you 're not sure I believe in a bad mood , '' said the man . He was wearing a suit . He was wearing a suit . <newline> <newline> `` Sir , I swear to god , we 've got an emergency . '' <newline> <newline> `` That 's right , Sir , '' said the man . `` We 'll call you after you 're done here . '' <newline> <newline> `` I 'm not sure I believe in this , '' said the man . `` I 'm not sure what I 'm expecting . '' <newline> <newline> `` Sir , '' said the man . `` It 's just not possible . The only way to explain it is to explain the situation . '' <newline> <newline> `` Sir , '' said the man . `` What 's going on ? '' <newline>

The sound of the sea wakes me from my sleep . <newline> <newline> I open my eyes and am greeted by darkness . Bewildered , I grope around in a panic until I realise I ’ ve been dreaming . It ’ s the same dream every time- I ’ m walking on a sandy beach . The sun is beating down on me , and I ’ m pleasantly hot . I can taste the salt of the ocean air , feel the soft sand beneath my feet and hear the roar of the waves . I am surrounded by golden sand and endless stretches of sea . I look down and see my shadow next to me . I look down to discern its shape , and then I wake up . The few seconds between dreaming and being awake are bliss . Then the hard reality comes crashing down on me . <newline> <newline> I look out the window . There ’ s a moon tonight . The neighbourhood is lit up in a soft glow . It ’ s risky , but I have to take what I ’ ve got . Hurriedly , I pull on some jeans and a hoodie and venture out into the darkness . The cold chill of the air hits me and I begin to shiver . I walk briskly . At night , everything is silent . It ’ s too late for anyone except for creeps like me to be awake . All the houses look large and imposing . The trees cast long shadows in the street and shake when the wind rushes through them . I start to jog to warm up , and soon I ’ m sweating . I think back to my dream . Every time , I feel so close to finding out what my shadow is supposed to be . If only I could stay a few seconds longer , I would find out . And then… <newline> <newline> I ’ m so immersed in my thoughts that I fail to notice someone on the other side of the road . We both see each other at the same time , and eye each other warily . Fortunately the moon has passed behind the clouds . He looks around my age ; another bored teenager traversing the streets at night . Only he ’ s not impaired like me . He looks up at the sky and slowly starts to walk towards a streetlight . The universal sign of peace . I see his shadow come into view . It ’ s a dog . I ’ m guessing a golden retriever . Under the lamplight , both the boy and the dog stare at me , alert . If I was a normal person , a ‘ good guy ’ , I ’ d come under the lamplight and show him I have a normal shadow too . But I don ’ t . I turn around and walk in the other direction , and hear him break into a run . He ’ s afraid of me . The only reason anyone avoids the light is if they ’ re ‘ bad ' . Their character is reflected in their shadows . An evil man creates a monster . <newline> <newline> I shiver again , but this time it ’ s from loneliness . Why couldn ’ t I be like everyone else ? Why couldn ’ t I have a shadow . The moon comes out from behind the clouds and the light hits me . I walk , but there is nothing beside me . Hopefully I won ’ t meet anyone again tonight . There are still a few hours left before sunrise .
`` <unk> ! '' <unk> said , as he looked over the group of people in the group . `` What are you doing here ? '' <newline> <newline> `` You 're a fucking <unk> !

My parents have told me that I 'm the only one in my family .
